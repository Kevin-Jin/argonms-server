2011-01-11  GoldenKevin  (revision 1)

	Automatically created /trunk directory. We recommend you to put all your
	code there

2011-01-22  GoldenKevin  (revision 2)

	* Initial import. Things currently working:
		* Inter server communications between a central server and remote
		servers.
		* Loading of Item.wz, Map.wz, Mob.wz, Reactor.wz, Skill.wz, and
		String.wz data files in KVJ format. MCDB support soon to come with XML
		and WZ support planned in the long run.
		* Game, login, and shop servers can listen and decode packets received
		from MapleStory clients, but do not process anything yet. There has been
		a little headway in login server packet handling.
		* A code stub for a telnet acceptor on the center server. It accepts
		connections but there are many things that need to be done before I can
		even think about implementing commands on it.
	Some more work has to be done on the actual client and server communications
	frameworks, but once that is done, I will start working on implementing
	packet handlers in the login server first. A lot of low level code was taken
	from OdinMS-derived sources in order to speed up development. Thanks guys!

2011-01-22  GoldenKevin  (revision 3)

	* Added AGPLv3 license headers to all Java source files.

2011-01-23  GoldenKevin  (revision 4)

	* Removed "argonms.*.data.dir" for all client listening servers because it
	is no longer used (Please specify the data directory with the System
	property "argonms.data.dir")
	* Added MCDB loading for maps data. Item data is soon to come followed by
	the rest.
	* Added error checking for KVJ loaders. When a piece of data doesn't exist,
	the entry in the caches will be null and the load methods will no longer
	throw FileNotFoundExceptions.
	* String data now has to be preloaded on any server that uses it.
	* Every data cache object now has a protected access modifier for all of
	their mutator methods and for their constructor, while only their accessor
	methods have public access. This way, the dynamically loaded data containing
	these static cache objects cannot modify them for the other dynamic data
	that use the same cache.

2011-01-23  GoldenKevin  (revision 5)

	* Finished MCDB data loader for items.
	* Merged WzDatabaseConnection into DatabaseConnection.
	* Refactored DatabaseConnection to be more efficient I suppose?

2011-01-25  GoldenKevin  (revision 6)

	* Added MCDB data loading for strings.
	* Please note that a new version of KVJ compiler is released. Please
	recompile all KVJ files!
	* I think I forgot all about how ThreadLocal worked when I created those
	MCDB data loading classes... anyway, the getWzConnection() is called at each
	method call now instead of being stored as a single instance variable for
	all threads.
	* Made constructors of all data loaders to protected and added
	(instance == null) check for every setInstance method just so nobody
	"accidentally" creates more than one instance of those singleton classes. I
	don't mistake you guys as idiots, it's just a safe programming practice.
	* Added MCDB loading for mobs and skills and enabled loading for strings
	(a whoops from the last revision).
	* All data loaders have an canLoad() method now to check if the data for an
	object exists (all except for String apparently). Note that this is not an
	exists() method, i.e. MCDB skills will return true even if the skill does
	not exist as long as there are other skills with the same 3 digit prefix. It
	only determines whether a piece of data can be loaded.
	* In Skill data loader, the player skill operations are now separated from
	those of mob skills, as they rightfully should be.
	* I'm really getting ahead of myself by adding a MapFactory instance
	variable in argonms.game.WorldChannel.

2011-01-29  GoldenKevin  (revision 7)

	* Made some progress on the Telnet listener. Now special telnet chars
	( > 0x7F) are handled properly and won't be in the ASCII string. Just a few
	more tweaks to the way some ASCII chars are handled and it will be ready...
	* Fixed NullPointerException in SkillDataLoader.
	* Fixed MCDB loading of mobs and skills.
	* Added classes for inventory (items, equips, pets, rings, etc.) and moved
	Player class from argonms.game to argonms.character.
	* Support for KvjCompiler r14. Changes include Character.wz compiling and
	reduced size of Mob files.
	* Character.wz is now processed in KvjItemDataLoader. Taming Mob IDs are now
	read in McdbItemDataLoader as well. In McdbItemDataLoader, equips can now be
	made tradeBlocked.

2011-02-04  GoldenKevin  (revision 8)

	* Fixed some inconsistencies when passing java.awt.Point/(x,y) parameters to
	mutator methods in data loader objects. Now all parameters are passed as
	x and y integers to reduce imports.
	* Renamed IItem to InventorySlot. Equips don't have any bonuses for "hands"
	so that was removed from the Equip class. Inventory class now implemented.
	Pets now are implemented and Rings have been updated.
	* Player class has been implemented enough for Login Server usage. Some code
	was copied directly from OdinMS, so some stuff needed for the Game Server
	do not work yet or are inefficient (ahem, MapleMap.nearestSpawnPoint).
	* Login server now has matured to a point where the client can be
	transferred to the game server! Characters can be created and loaded from
	world charlists and global charlists. Fixed some
	ArrayIndexOutOfBoundExceptions caused by off by one errors.
	* Refactored Game Server accept in Login Server. Now the IP address of each
	world is resolved upon their connection so we won't have to do it every time
	a client selects a character in the Login Server.
	* GameClient has been updated. There are small stubs of code for Game Server
	loading of a player (copied directly from OdinMS), although there's still a
	long way before the player can actually be placed in a map.
	* Added a CheatTracker class that does... nothing! Yet.

2011-02-12  GoldenKevin  (revision 9)

	* Fixed logging of unhandled packets from clients.
	* Moved argonms.net.client.ClientLoginPacketProcessor
	to argonms.login.ClientLoginPacketProcessor
	* Moved argonms.net.client.ClientGamePacketProcessor
	to argonms.game.ClientGamePacketProcessor
	* Moved argonms.net.client.ClientShopPacketProcessor
	to argonms.shop.ClientShopPacketProcessor
	* Moved several constants from KvjEffects to StatEffects because their use
	wasn't limited to KVJ effects loading.
	* Added accessor methods to MobSkillEffect and StatEffects. Lt and Rb
	mutator methods for MobSkillEffects now accept two shorts instead of a Point
	* Fixed negative array index size occurring when packet length was greater
	than the maximum value (127) of a signed 8-bit integer (byte).
	* Fixed finding the next free item position in inventory
	(Inventory.getFreeSlots). First item is 1, not 0!
	* Added Taming Mobs/Mounts as another inventory item type. Hopefully, this
	should be the last one as the inheritance for InventorySlot is getting
	complicated...
	* Player can now enter a map in the GameServer. While they can move, they
	can't see other players and other players can't see them. They cannot
	interact with anything or change maps/channels and there are no spawns for
	NPCs/Mobs. All of these additions will come gradually.

2011-02-19  GoldenKevin  (revision 10)

	* Fixed bug in LittleEndianByteArrayWriter. If a large enough byte array was
	copied to a small buffer, there was an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Also,
	a one byte long LittleEndianByteArrayWriter can now grow!
	* Renamed MapleMap to GameMap.
	* You can now see other players moving around in a map (you can't see them
	attacking yet though). NPCs are visible (at least in map 0), but I think
	mobs currently crash clients. Portals still don't work yet... A lot of
	credit should go to OdinMS for this particular update!
	* Made some progress on making a scripting interface for NPCs. I think I
	might actually write my own language if I don't find ways to circumvent my
	current issues with it. A sample 2100.js script is included.
	* Added code stubs for NPC shops. It should be easy to implement later on.
	* Refactored map object related code. Players now keep their charid in the
	MapObject class (referred to as an "object id"). I think MapObjects are a
	bit more modular/OO now...
	* Fixed bug where an account was recorded as being logged in even if their
	login attempt was not successful. Also fixed a client error reading bug.
	* canLoad methods for the data loaders now check if the stats are in the
	cache before delving into their IO routines.
	* And a whole lot of other bug fixes/improvements on things that I was not
	able to spot before.
	Kvj structure updated - Update your KvjCompiler and recompile your data.
	Consult the KvjBin changelog to see a list of changes in r15.

2011-02-21  GoldenKevin  (revision 11)

	* Improved "say" commands for NPC scripts. Now the "prev" button is handled
	correctly, although you have to keep in mind special cases and limitations.
	(read the comments in NpcConversationActions for more details).
	* Mozilla's latest version of Rhino (1.72R2) is now used instead of Java 6's
	modified version 1.6R2 in javax.script. 1.72R2 is much more flexible and
	contains features that I needed for efficient stateless NPC scripts. Now
	endChat hooks are supported and each NPC script doesn't require a dedicated
	thread anymore. Updated Sera script to show a bit of it's capabilities.
	(you don't have to have a endChat function and scripts don't need any
	functions. Just be sure to call the function in the global scope if you do
	want to invoke one). Be sure your classpath now includes Rhino's js.jar.
	* A bunch of other code stubs for map/channel changing, and for channel
	variables (e.g. exp, meso, and drop rates) that I will finish in the future.
	Some routines that were previously LoginClient specific are now common.

2011-02-23  GoldenKevin  (revision 12)

	* Replaced isSealed() checks with our own boolean instance variable in
	NpcConversationActions. I realized you can't seal it before throwing the
	continuation, but I can't throw the continuation before sealing it. I didn't
	catch this before because it's a very rare occurrence to have the script
	forcefully halted while in the middle of evaluation (and not while waiting
	for a response) - Rhino/JavaScript isn't THAT slow. I'm probably going to
	have to also synchronize the terminated variable, but I will leave it the
	way it is until I start get cases of it acting up.
	* NpcConversationActions.askAvatar now returns the player's selection.
	* Some InventorySlot changes. Unique IDs are now long. Corrected pet packet
	structure - footholds are now short, and the other two bytes were actually
	bools. Ring's partnerRingUid are now long (even though the current packet
	structure for rings gives it as an int).
	* Renamed GameHandler to GameEnterHandler to disambiguate it's purpose
	somewhat (since it handles connections and map entering).
	* Completely rewrote interserver communication to accommodate splitted
	worlds, i.e. so that all channels of one world don't have to be running on
	the same process (so that channels can be spread out across many servers).
	Modified game0.properties, game1.properties, and added game2.properties to
	demonstrate how to use the new features.
	* Restructured classes for interserver communications. Classes only required
	by the Center Server are now in the argonms.center package, and only the
	classes required by the remote servers (e.g. abstract classes) or required
	by both the Center Server and remote servers (e.g. packet header values) are
	located in argonms.net.server. Many classes have been renamed and overall
	there has been a huge refactoring in the structure.

2011-02-23  GoldenKevin  (revision 13)

	* Some code cleanup after that large revision I just previously committed.
	* Channel changing is now supported. Portals can now be entered and you will
	be properly warped (clients still crash when they encounter mobs though, I'm
	working on that fix right now...)
	* Renamed argonms.game.npcscript to argonms.game.script. Added a new class
	for Portal scripts and updated NpcScriptManager with quest script stubs in
	order to support quests in the future.

2011-02-27  GoldenKevin  (revision 14)

	* KvjCompiler has been updated to r16, which fixes Skill.wz compiling.
	* Renamed MapObject (and related classes) to MapEntity to disambiguate any
	confusion with Java objects. In a language where pretty much everything is
	an object, Entity suggests something more real and existential.
	* Fixed an oversight in Inventory.getFreeSlots. Added a canFitEntirely in
	InventoryTools in case we want to check if an item fits completely before
	calling InventoryTools.addToInventory (whose behavior is to fit as many as
	possible). Changed the return type of addToInventory to accommodate another
	usage for it. Fixed InventoryTools.equip, overloaded unequip to support
	cases where we want to fetch the next available slot, added isEquip(int) to
	replace usages of getCategory(int).equals("Equip"), added isTwoHanded and
	getWeaponType for future updates, and getCategory now returns an
	InventoryType (original method has been renamed to getCategoryName).
	* Mobs don't crash the game anymore, and are animated. Other players still
	cannot see when you attack them (or if you just swing your weapon), and you
	still cannot hurt them. Attack parsing/processing is very complicated and
	will take some time to be completed.
	* Skill levels of players are now saved to the database.
	SkillLevel accessor methods now return byte values.
	* Fixed Player.isVisible() returning the opposite value.
	* Items and mesos can now be dropped and picked up by players, and will
	expire properly. Fixed some visual glitches in ItemDrop. It should work with
	mob drops as well, but I still can't attack them so I can't test it (player
	inventories don't show change in meso values unless they relog because I
	still haven't coded stat updates, but they are modified internally).
	* Got the real packet send opcode for removing NPCs from a map using a
	little bit of educated guessing (I'm surprised that Vana and the more
	popular flavors of OdinMS haven't figured this one out yet). Also, NPCs now
	send their control packet to every player that joins the map (why do we have
	to do that?)
	* Only users with elevated privileges can use the /m command to change maps.
	* Fixed the access modifier of LittleEndianReader.skip. It should be public!

2011-02-27  GoldenKevin  (revision 15)

	* Fixed bug with InventoryTools.equip when equipping shields or two handed
	weapons.
	* I realized how broken endConversation still is. I guess we can only hope
	that there are no blocking operations in the scripts and that there we would
	be a quick call to any one of the NpcConversationAction methods that throw
	a ContinuationPending so that we can dispose of the script, because from
	what I see, there is no way to interrupt an executing script.
	* Replaced synchronized blocks in GameMap with a ReentrantReadWriteLock for
	better performance with the read heavy Collections. Hopefully I know my
	concurrency stuff and we won't have deadlocks arising from this update...
	* Renamed MapEntity.getShowObjectMessage to getShowEntityMessage. Missed
	that one when I went through the renaming sweep...
	* Replaced PortalActions' Player instance variable with a GameClient one.
	If the PortalActions object somehow survived and the Player would not be
	garbage collected as a result of that one reference, it would be cheaper to
	keep a GameClient instead of a Player object. I could have used a
	WeakReference<Player>, but I think a GameClient instance is more useful
	than a Player instance in the Portal's context anyway.
	* WeakReference<Player> is now used for Mob controller references in case
	a mob is still alive when the Player leaves the server. I'm not sure how I
	will use highestDamageKiller, so that still is a regular Player reference.
	* Fixed some instantiations of LittleEndianByteArrayWriter to use the
	correct amount of bytes when using the constructor that specifies the array
	size. Forgot to update some of them when I rewrote inter server comms.
	* Fixed logging for RemoteServerListener and the problem with swallowing
	exceptions. Forgot to update logging.properties when I rearranged classes
	involving inter server communication.

2011-02-27  GoldenKevin  (revision 16)

	I played around with SVN special properties a bit, and made these changes
	(Subversion/auto-props is awesome):
	* Bash scripts for Linux now have the property "svn:executable" set.
	* Added "svn:eol-style" properties that make sense for each text file -
	e.g. CHANGES, LICENSE, *.properties, *.sql, *.java, and *.js files are set
	to native; *.bat are set to CRLF; and *.sh are set to LF. Any new text files
	will also have these eol-styles based on their file extension/file name
	* Added svn:mime-type to most files (except .bat and .sh files, because they
	have mime types beginning with "application/", and that wouldn't work out
	too well with SVN's handling of diffs). *.jar files now have a mime-type of
	application/java-archive instead of the generic application/octet-stream.

2011-03-04  GoldenKevin  (revision 17)

	* Fixed Player pets not showing to rest of map, and NPC control packets not
	being sent to players. Packets had to be sent separately and could not be
	combined, so now MapEntity.getShowEntityMessage() and getCreationMessage()
	return an array of byte arrays (and their method names are now plural!) It
	may have a performance penalty for any entity that didn't send multiple
	packets when spawned, but it should increase performance of Player and NPC
	spawns (no more copying arrays). NPCs are now animated.
	* Fixed non-ranged entities not sending their creation packet to everyone in
	the map, and ranged entities sending their creation packet to everyone in
	the map (yep, I had them swapped).
	* Added a convenience method for writing a 4-byte Point to a stream and for
	reading such a Point from a stream. Refactored code accordingly.
	* PlayerLog now uses two ConcurrentHashMaps instead of monitor synchronized
	vanilla HashMaps to reduce complexity and hopefully improve performance.
	* Updated GameMap to use a separate ReadWriteLock for each Collection to
	improve performance (also fixes a deadlock when respawning monsters).
	* Somewhat solved the Center server concurrency issues by only allowing
	one server to connect at a time so that when servers that need to notify
	each other connect at the exact same time, they will not potentially miss a
	message. Also, added a disconnected variable in CenterRemoteInterface in
	case a server disconnects while there is a read going on (and we have to
	wait for a write lock before we are able to remove/null the server).
	* Channels now send their actual load instead of just an increment/decrement
	notification. This is in case a login server disconnects and reconnects and
	they don't know the previous loads. Will decrease performance somewhat
	because we have to call size() on a ConcurrentHashMap in PlayerLog instead
	of being able to send a constant true or false...
	* Renamed disconnect methods to disconnected to avoid possible confusion.
	* Fixed error in Kvj Skill.wz loading caused by prop being read an int
	instead of a short.
	* Monsters can now die from regular melee attacks. Skills, magic attacks,
	and arrow/star/bullet attacks still are still not handled yet. Respawning
	seems to be bugged, so I'll have to fix that up. Players still do not take
	damage from mobs, so I'll be working on that as well.
	* Inventory mesos count is now updated when you drop/pick up mesos.
	* Renamed argonms.loading.StatEffects to StatEffectsData and moved all of
	its constants to the class argonms.StatEffect. Likewise renamed ItemEffect
	and SkillEffect to ItemEffectsData and SkillEffectsData respectively.
	* Cooldowns should be handled properly once implemented. Execute the updated
	SQL so that you won't get database exceptions when loading/saving characters

2011-03-12  GoldenKevin  (revision 18)

	* Fixed items dropped by players not having the correct quantity.
	* Mobs now spawn first at the SpawnPoint with the lowest amount of mobs
	alive (or, whichever has the lowest nextPossibleSpawn if there are any that
	have the same amount alive), not the first spawn that was added to the map.
	* Improved some methods in LittleEndianReader and LittleEndianWriter. Bytes
	are now buffered more so that for most methods, only one method is called
	and is passed a byte array, instead of many methods being called that pass
	individual bytes. Avoids invocation overhead, and there is only one bounds
	check for ByteArrayWriter and faster performance for StreamWriter/Reader.
	* Fixed query errors when saving/loading pets.
	* Get slot max now returns 1 for pet items (if not loading from MCDB).
	* Optimized HexTool a little bit.
	* Added a stub for a command processor. Any chats that begin with an
	exclamation point (!) or an at sign (@) will not be broadcast, and will be
	sent to CommandProcessor.process(), which does nothing at the moment.

2011-03-21  GoldenKevin  (revision 19)

	* Fixed some bottlenecks in LittleEndianReader and LittleEndianWriter that
	resulted from the last update. When reading strings, we assume it is ASCII,
	so we can just assume a char is only one byte, avoiding the overhead of
	CharSet for encoding. Reading and writing 16-bit and 32-bit integers by
	copying an array is faster for Stream I/O, but the old methods worked faster
	for byte arrays. Therefore, I overloaded the read/write int and
	read/write short methods in the byte array reader/writer classes.
	* Fixed issue where you couldn't do anything after you visited a scripted
	portal that doesn't warp you anywhere (added PortalActions.abortWarp).
	* Portals point to a null map if they do not have a tm property (previously,
	they pointed to map 0, which is a perfectly valid map, but is probably
	unintended).
	* Added NPCs that will warp you from the Mushroom Town Training Camp to the
	outside world.
	* Updated KvjBin to r17. Major changes include the inclusion of mob summons
	data needed for a mob skill, the lowering of the word size of several
	integer properties, and custom mob drops. MCDB should also be able to load
	mob summons data. KvjCompiler has been tweaked as well, and all crashes and
	freezes should be fixed (I performed a full compile with no errors).
	* Fixed loading of mobs. When I fixed player skill's prop reading, I forgot
	about making the same change in mob skills.
	* Preparing for the inclusion of mob player-diseases and mob self-buffs.
	* Added preliminary take damage handler. All physical mob attacks should be
	handled correctly. No mob skills should be handled correctly at all. Healing
	through standing still now changes your hp/mp accordingly.
	* Facial expressions should now broadcast to the map.
	* MCDB now loads mob attacks. Also fixed several bugs in MCDB (mob) loading.
	* Refactored MapEntity.getShowEntityMessage/getCreationMessage. Now only a
	byte array is returned, and we send the extra data in the GameMap methods
	in order to speed up sending data for map entities that do not have extra
	packets that need to be sent.

2011-03-24  GoldenKevin  (revision 20)

	* Refactored player buffs and diseases. Combined them into a single
	PlayerStatusEffect. MobSkillEffectsData is now related to SkillEffectsData
	(which has been renamed to PlayerSkillEffectsData) and ItemEffectsData.
	* Modified GameMap to take advantage of several new classes that I wrote so
	I could remove all the lock instance data, which helps declutter it. I only
	added documentation for Lockable(Hash)Map, but I'm sure you can infer what
	the other similar classes do once you read through that.
	* Fixed NullPointerException in login server when a game server is closed
	after it has connected to the center server but before it is ready/online.
	It was an issue in the center server code that I overlooked...
	* Tidied up the encryption/decryption routines to conform more to my
	standards.
	* All creations of a Random instance and every call to Math.random has been
	replaced with a call to a centralized Rng class. The class is ThreadLocal,
	so it should perform a slight bit better than Math.random when there are
	many concurrent calls, and should reduce the amount of instantiations of
	Random as it is now one instance per thread.

2011-04-04  GoldenKevin  (revision 21)

	(argonms.jar WILL NO LONGER BE RECOMPILED IN EVERY REVISION. THIS BLOATS
	THE SVN REPOSITORY, SO FROM NOW ON, YOU WILL HAVE TO BUILD IT YOURSELF FROM
	NETBEANS OR EXPORT A .JAR FILE IN ECLIPSE). If your NetBeans project is not
	named argonms, you may have to rename the .jar file when you compile it.
	* Renamed all buff methods in Mob to effect to be consistent with Player
	class and because not on effects placed on monsters are buffs, i.e. debuffs.
	* Player disease cancels are now removed when a player logs off.
	* All methods in PlayerScriptInteraction are to be in third person when
	dealing with actions done to the player to be consistent with mobs and
	other map life, as the script performs actions on the player. The script
	should not be the player.
	* Reorganized some code: moved mob drop routines from GameMap to Mob;
	reordered and added gain/set methods of Player in a logical manner;
	Added more PlayerJob and Skills constants; PlayerStatusEffectValues cleaned;
	PlayerScriptInteraction is the ancestor of NpcConversationActions and
	PortalActions (both of which are no longer static classes);
	PortalScriptManager.runScript now returns a boolean, which is changed by
	PortalActions.abortWarp (instead of sending CommonPackets.writeEnableActions
	in abortWarp, the call to it is now handled by the caller of runScript);
	split CommonPackets.writeShowItemGain into writeShowItemGainFromQuest and
	removed inChat variable; Merging of header and body in ClientListener gone,
	we just send the header and the body arrays to ChannelBuffers.copiedBuffer.
	Although we still have to eventually merge the two arrays by copying, it
	makes our own code tidier as the copying logic is done elsewhere; Reordered
	CommonPackets methods; Added constants to ItemDrop to deal with magic nums.
	* Added a writeStyledChat method in GameChatHandler. This will probably be
	the only "fun" feature I add to this source in a long time.
	* Added support to specify scripts directory from a command line option.
	This was necessary for the proper functioning of the ArgonMS GUI Launcher.
	* Fixed any glitches that would have occurred for account item storage/
	account cash shop storage. An update to your SQL database is necessary.
	* Implemented CommandProcessor with an implementation that isn't the most
	efficient, but is better designed than alternatives. In order to create a
	command definition, you must specify the help text with it.
	* Item drop packet is more accurate.
	* Mobs now give exp when they die, and I believe level up and the stat gains
	that are associated with it work properly. Still gotta implement exp loss
	when a player dies...
	* Enabled GameRegistry. Properties are now loaded from game#.properties, and
	so far getExpRate(), getDropRate(), getMesoRate(), and doMultiLevel() are
	used somewhere on the game server.
	* Fixed drop placement from mob deaths.

2011-04-06  GoldenKevin  (revision 22)

	* Added help message to !rate command.
	* Fixed freakish positioning of drops when dropping on a rope or in the air.
	* Show inventory full message when picking up a drop and inventory is full.
	* Fixed deadlock when item drops expired.
	* Random.nextDouble methods used in MobStats for chance calculations are now
	replaced with nextInt. Should now be less biased and maybe faster (both of
	which are results of having fewer floating point operations).
	* Fixed issue with mob drops where the items don't appear to come from the
	mob (they just rose and fell in the x coordinate that they rest in, not from
	the mob's center).

2011-04-06  GoldenKevin  (revision 23)

	* Mobs now show HP bar when attacked (and boss HP bar should show up to the
	whole map, but it's untested as of commit time).
	* Reorganized mob drop routines to allow and take advantage of code reuse
	when reactor drops are implemented. These functions are now in GameMap.
	* Self destructing mobs will now show the correct animation and will die at
	the proper HP impetus.
	* Fixed bug when using the command /m 0. Incorrectly recognized as a death
	warp. Also fixed unnecessary writeEnableActions that are sent to the client
	no matter the result of a portal warp (forgot to return the value returned
	by enterPortal(Player, PortalData) in enterPortal(Player, String) if the
	search for a portal with a matching name was found). I think clients are
	stuck waiting for a response when using the /m command, so if the client
	does not have sufficient privileges or just does not warp, it is sent a
	writeEnableActions.
	* Players will be sent to their forced return map when they log in if their
	map has one (it's better than sending them to the forced return map when
	they log off because in the case the server crashes, they still will be
	warped back the next time they log back on).
	* Added decrease HP tasks that are present in several maps, as well as a
	map time limit task. The implementations may leak memory, so I'm going to
	profile them later (Stupid ScheduledFuture.cancel).
	* Players going through the Mushroom Town Training Camp or the Showa Spa
	will be given the appropriate costumes.

2011-04-10  GoldenKevin  (revision 24)

	* Don't explode Mob if one hit KO'ed.
	* Fixed bug where a player was unable to warp if they picked up mesos.
	* Players will not pick up meso drops if it makes them exceed the maximum
	amount (2147483647).
	* Added a meso option to the !stat command. Values greater than 2147483647
	will no longer throw a NumberFormatException on the server, but instead will
	send a syntax message to the client.
	* Cleaned up time limit stuff in GameMap. The clock is automatically removed
	by the client when the player changes maps, so we don't have to send the
	clock close message.
	* Tentative fix for visible ranged map entities disappearing when jumping
	down. May need tweaking in the future.
	* Renamed any remnants of variables/methods with names based on map entity's
	previous name of map object in order to eliminate any confusion.
	* Made Player.visibleEntities a LockableList as there is a possibility of
	concurrent access from GameMap and from Player on different threads.
	* Temporary fix for client freeze when multiple map item drops visibly
	disappear at the exact same time. Will need further testing to get to the
	root of the problem. The current fix suggests that the underlying problem is
	a thread concurrency problem.
	* Slightly optimized WorldlistHandler.loadCharacters so only one database
	query is needed.
	* Updated argon.sql again because I forgot to specify the constraint for
	`inventoryitems`.`accountid`.
	* Some refactoring in GameMap - drop(ItemDrop) is no longer public and must
	be indirectly called by the public overloaded drop methods.
	* No longer show "You have gained +-x mesos" when dropping mesos.

2011-04-13  GoldenKevin  (revision 25)

	* Added support for modifications of the key map.
	* Renamed GamePlayerHandler to GamePlayerMiscHandler.
	* Starting to code support for castable/usable/consumable skills/items.
	Added support for:
		* Magic Guard
		* Hide (which was half coded in already anyway)
		* And the parts of any skill that generically increases [m|w][atk|def],
		speed, jump, etc.
	* Fixed MCDB skill data loading adding every effect for any skill.
	* Fixed a lot of StatusEffectsData problems. Please update to KvjBin r18 and
	recompile your Skill.wz and Item.wz.
	* You can cast and cancel buff skills and items (including Hide, which
	should be applied to every GM when they log in). Whether the skill/item
	actually buffs you is a whole 'nother story. Working on them at the moment
	though...
	* Potions that simply heal your HP or MP should work.
	* Hide actually makes you appear like you're in Dark Sight, but you can
	still cast skills and attack (credits to Vana for that one).
	* There is now a distinction between a Player's base stats and his stats
	adjusted with buffs. The current implementation works, but it's not perfect
	yet (still looking for any alternatives that may be faster), so watk, wdef,
	matk, mdef, acc, eva, hands, speed, and jump bonuses from skills and equips;
	str, dex, int, luk, hp, and mp bonuses from equips; and hp and mp percentage
	based increases from hyperbody are now recognized on the server. Str, dex,
	int, and luk are under the assumption that all bonuses are by addition only,
	(i.e. no percentages). If any percentage based bonuses are introduced for
	those aforementioned stats, then they will have to use similar routines to
	those of maxHp and maxMp (albeit without the remHp and remMp checks).
	* Added support for pings being sent to idle connections.
	* Enabled TCP_NO_DELAY (disabling Nagle's Algorithm) because it caused some
	noticeable latency when connecting from anywhere besides localhost
	(especially demonstrated by a monster dropping multiple items).
	* Fixed a frequent source of NullPointerExceptions in TakeDamageHandler.
	* Fixed ranged monsters not appearing when a player warps to a map and warps
	back.
	* Added !skill and !give commands for GMs. "!stat set exp 0" now works if
	you are level 200.

2011-04-14  GoldenKevin  (revision 26)

	* Renamed package argonms.net.client to argonms.net.external and
	argonms.net.server to argonms.net.internal. Thus, external refers to any
	communications with a MapleStory client, while internal refers to inter-
	server communications with other servers that use the ArgonMS protocol.
	* Distributed all classes from argonms.net.external.handler into packages
	specific for each type of server (i.e. argonms.game/login/shop.handler).

2011-04-20  GoldenKevin  (revision 27)

	* Moved argonms.tools.Pair to argonms.tools.collections.Pair, and got rid of
	its accessor and mutator methods. left and right values of a Pair are now
	immutable and can be directly accessed by the public members left and right.
	* Updated logging.properties to refer to the new locations of some classes.
	* Added a !spawn command.
	* Added a !tp command to teleport one player to another, and an !info
	command that gives the location of a player. Both require that any
	referenced characters are on the same channel as the caller.
	(PlayerLog.getPlayer(String) is now case insensitive).
	* Fixed "!stat set exp 0" at level 200.
	* Replaced usages of Pair<List<String>, List<String>> in InventoryTools with
	the more semantical and succinct static nested class UpdatedSlots.
	* Consume on pickup items should now function correctly.
	* Standardized methods for getting the WZ identifier of certain entities, as
	well as maps themselves (e.g. Mob.getMobId() is now Mob.getDataId()).
	* Added a getDataId() method to Player even though it returns the same value
	as getId() at the moment. Will make future refactoring easier if I choose to
	differentiate between a Player's database character id and the Player's map
	entity id.
	* Renamed MapEntity.MapEntityType to EntityType.
	* GameMap.entities is now split up into separate entity pools since the
	client has separate pools for each entity type. Should solve some issues
	with entity id exhaustion on busy maps (and remove the artificial limit of
	30000 non-Player entities per map). The SQL has been updated to reflect
	these changes on the Player's side.
	* Readded foothold IDs to the data. KvjCompiler updated to r19. Please
	recompile your Map.wz.
	* Equips from monster drops now have randomized stats.
	* Fixed some monster drop issues when dropping certain equips.
	* Added Miniroom and PlayerShop map entity stub classes. HiredMerchant
	extends PlayerShop now instead of Npc.
	* Fixed mob deaths when using MCDB.

2011-04-22  GoldenKevin  (revision 28)

	* Moved !spawn command into a separate class.
	* Added a !id command to look up the data ID of an object based on its name.
	* Implemented player NPC packets. Still haven't worked on saving/loading and
	the placement of them though (I provided a !playernpc command to create a
	temporary one of yourself).
	* Fixed up NPC packets. writeShowNpc is redundant if we send writeControlNpc
	Renamed writeControlNpc to writeShowAndControlNpc. Fixed removing NPCs (we
	have to call writeStopControlAndRemoveNpc instead of just plain
	writeRemoveNpc, which only works if we wrote writeShowNpc to spawn the NPC).
	* Player NPCs and regular NPCs share the same entity pool. Removed
	EntityType.PLAYER_NPC.
	* Mobs begin immediately animating when a player leaves hide. Although they
	will still continue animating even after the player goes into hide until the
	player changes maps.
	* Spawned NPCs now are in the direction of the player when it was spawned.
	* Fixed issues with mobs not animating when a player enters a map.
	* No more unhandled packet messages when passing by a Maple TV.
	* Combined several EntityTypes that I believe would be in the same entity
	pool on the client. Now, the entity types that were combined have a more
	specific sub entity type to identify each distinct map entity.
	* Reorganized miniroom stuff in a more sensical manner.
	* Modified the behavior of map entities, and made the usages of isAlive()
	and isVisible() more standardized. Ranged entities are added to the Player's
	visible map entities when spawned (instead of when the Player starts moving)
	and moving mobs will be included in the Player's visible map entities if
	they move toward the Player's view. Dead ranged entities are now removed
	from a Player's visible map entities.
	* Reactors are now visible, although you can't destroy them.

2011-04-25  GoldenKevin  (revision 29)

	* Locked some more things that needed locking in GameMap.
	* StringDataLoader has been brought up to the standards of the rest of the
	DataLoaders. Optimized McdbStringDataLoader.
	* Started adding support for KvJ Quest.wz loading. Update to KvjBin r22.
	MCDB Quest loading soon to come (so far, the names of quests are loaded in
	MCDB so you can perform an ID lookup on them through the !id command).
	Quests are preloaded unconditionally (like Strings) because Quest.wz
	contains too few files (and each of which are relatively small) to justify
	any checking to see if a piece of data has been loaded or not and any
	synchronization overhead.
	* Fixed hide expiring immediately when using MCDB.
	* Made quite a lot of headway into implementing quests. Finished many code
	stubs. There is still a lot to do (not all QuestRewards are done and not all
	QuestChecks are performed) and quests that rely on the destruction of
	reactors are not finishable at the moment.
	* Fixed expiredate field in the inventoryitems table. It is now a 8-byte
	integer instead of a 4-byte one. Added queststatuses and questmobprogress
	tables for saving a player's quest progress. Please update your database.
	* Added a PacketSubHeaders class. Read the class javadoc for more info.
	* The assorted timestamps that are sent to clients are now adjusted
	according to the server's time zone upon server start. Previously, each
	timestamp was in UTC time.
	* Added quest scripts for Roger's Apple.

2011-04-27  GoldenKevin  (revision 30)

	* Fixed McdbItemDataLoader so that it works when using a clean MCDB 3.0.
	Sorry, I forgot that my MCDB schema was customized to include additional
	information that is not present in the clean dump.
	* Refactored mob req stuff for quest status. No need to keep a copy of the
	mob reqs in each quest entry... Every quest completion requirement is now
	checked, and if the Player satisfies all of them, he will receive the proper
	"Quest completed" notification. Implementation-wise, I'm basically doing a
	two way mapping between quests and their requirements in the Player class.
	* Item quest actions now function properly. Items can be given or taken away
	with the right quantity and the right notifications are sent to the client.
	* Implemented as much of McdbQuestDataLoader that I can. The clean MCDB
	quest data tables don't give me much to work with.
	* Implemented reactors. I tested it on several simple ones (such as 2000 in
	Amherst for Pio's quest) but I haven't tried any item triggered or touch
	triggered reactors yet. Also added reactor scripts in case you want to
	perform some kind of specific action when a reactor is destroyed (or
	triggered to the end).
	* Split writeInventoryAddSlot from CommonPackets.writeInventorySlotUpdate as
	the two actions are relatively unrelated and there's no reason to have them
	combined in one method.

2011-05-03  GoldenKevin  (revision 31)

	* Skills and buff items should now expire properly.
	* Refactored StatusEffectTools and the Player class' interface for applying
	effects. StatusEffectTools now only contains common methods that all types
	of status effects (i.e. buff skills, buff items, debuffs from monsters).
	The specific behaviors for the aforementioned status effects are now split
	into their own classes.
	* Mob skill IDs are now represented internally as 2-bytes (short) instead of
	4-bytes (int). In order to simplify compiling of Skill.wz in KvjCompiler,
	mob skill IDs are still 4-bytes on the KVJ files (and are just downcasted).
	* Fixed unable to warp bug following a skill cast.
	* Fixed reactor and player drops being dropped from the wrong place if a mob
	with the same entity ID was visible on the map.
	* Added more definitions to PlayerJob.
	* Made some progress on ranged attacks (still nothing on magic attacks yet).
	* Rechargeable ammo (stars, bullets) are now a special case in the inventory
	manipulation functions in InventoryTools. Adding rechargeable items to the
	inventory will not change the quantity of non-full items that share the same
	item ID, and removing rechargeable items will not clear the slot if the new
	quantity equals 0.
	* Quest requirement watching in Player should perform a bit better now.

2011-05-05  GoldenKevin  (revision 32)

	* Messages are now sent to players on the same map when a player changes
	their equipment.
	* Added some sort of consistency to enum getValue/valueOf method names.
	PlayerStatusEffect keys have been renamed for consistency and to match with
	Java's standard naming convention for constants (i.e. underscores for names
	with spaces), and some to match with the source skill's name.
	* Every player on a map should be sent the buffs of a player that enters the
	map once that player enters (CommonPackets.writeShowPlayer). This method,
	like writeUseSkill, writeGiveDebuff, writeBuffMapEffect, and
	writeDebuffMapEffect, is extremely buggy and will crash clients pretty
	frequently. If you can reproduce any crashes resulting from buffs/debuffs,
	just send me a report of what skills were being used.
	* Fixed up attack skills A LOT. Meso explosion works perfectly fine, and I
	perfected my procedures through Vana inspirations and extensive testing.
	Note that this is only for ranged and melee attacks as of the moment, and
	summons, magic, and energy charge are not yet handled properly.
	* Fixed attacking when shadow stars is active.
	* Fixed cooldown saving in Player giving errors.

2011-05-07  GoldenKevin  (revision 33)

	* Merged BuffsData file into StatusEffectsData, while preserving the
	BuffsData class itself as an inner class for better organization.
	* Made some progress with mob status effects (player skills that give mobs
	debuffs, and mob skills that give the mob buffs). Still far from complete.
	* Renamed SkillTools.useBuffSkill to useCastSkill and readded duration check
	because not all skills that pass through GameBuffHandler.handleUseSkill is a
	buff (e.g. heal).
	* Cleaned up DealDamageHandler. Removed AmmoType enum and replaced it with a
	WeaponClass enum to match with the packet. Had to remove some ammo checks,
	but it is better designed and is less redundant (use info that client gave).
	* Removed unnecessary things from mob skill stats.

2011-05-08  GoldenKevin  (revision 34)

	* Fixed Roger's Apple giving the completion message at the wrong time.
	* Support for the various flavors of MP Eater.
	* Support for magic attacks. Much easier than I anticipated.
	* Support for !skill command to set a skill level to 0 (remove the skill).
	* Support for energy charge. It works for all weapons and jobs, so if
	somebody ever adds in a rebirth system, you better consider that.
	* DealDamageHandler now reports the correct mastery level of a player when
	sending attack packets to the map.
	* Supposedly added support for summon attacks, but I have no idea if it
	works since I didn't even implement summons yet. =P Nonetheless, that should
	make DealDamageHandler *nearly* feature complete.
	* Fixed stars/bullets being removed from inventory when exhausted. Stars
	show properly to other players on map.
	* Fixed MCDB loaded skills and quests.

2011-05-08  GoldenKevin  (revision 35)

	* Fixed quests not starting if they required the Player to have not started
	a different quest, and that Player did not forfeit it.
	* Fixed no mob respawns occurring in a map with few mob spawn points.
	* Added a !town command for quick access to some maps without having to look
	up the map id for it.
	* Support for cooldowns. Moved cooldown stuff to SkillTools.skillCastCosts
	as cooldowns are common for both attack skills and castable skills.
	* Cleaned up DealDamageHandler. We are given attackCount in the packet, so
	no need to recalculate that. Also, just store projectile item id in the
	AttackInfo structure so we don't have to pass it to the packet methods. Cash
	stars had precedence over the actual stars, so we should check the item IDs
	for cash stars after we check the regular ones.

2011-05-15  GoldenKevin  (revision 36)

	* KvjBin updated to r24.
	* Support for prepared skills, which include every keydown attack skills, as
	well as non-attacking skills like monster magnet and Chakra, and non-keydown
	attack skill like explosion (FP mage skill). All keydown skills are prepared
	but not all prepared skills are keydown? I don't understand the difference
	between them, but the game apparently does since only keydown skills give a
	charge integer in the attack packet (DealDamageHandler).
	* Some skill cast visual effects (like the eye that appears when a player
	casts Focus) that previously did not show now show.
	* Full support for Monster Magnet, Chakra, and Dash.
	* Fixed players that just entered a map seeing full Energy Charge on players
	with only a partial charge. Energy charge is not stored in Player's
	activeEffects until it reaches full charge.
	* Process summon types for summon skills in SkillDataLoader. Full support
	for summons and puppets.

2011-06-05  GoldenKevin  (revision 37)

	* You may now allocate ability (stat) points and skill points.
	* Code cleanup - removal of unused imports and variables/function calls.

2011-06-09  GoldenKevin  (revision 38)

	* Full support for minigames (i.e. omok and match cards).
	* Added new database table for recording minigame scores - update your SQL.
	* Full support for player trades.
	* Progress on all sorts of minirooms. Player shops are partially functional
	and hired merchants are still totally nonfunctional.

2011-06-14  GoldenKevin  (revision 39)

	* No more ranged map entities. Rationale:
		* Bandwidth of repeated packets used to show and hide entities as they
		went in and out of range for a player was costlier than sending each
		player the spawn packet for every entity on the map only once
		(especially the relatively huge spawn packet for mobs).
		* Saves memory server side since it no longer has to keep track of every
		mob/drop/etc. that is in range of a player.
		* Spares precious server CPU cycles that are used to check if a ranged
		entity is in range every time either a player moves or that ranged
		entity moves. No more CPU cycles wasted on costly thread safe operations
		with each player's "visibleEntities" pool.
		* Fixes ranged entities disappearing when a player jumps down. Concept
		of ranged entities became obsolete when players were able to jump down,
		allowing them to move from one point to another much faster than through
		any other kind of movement. The speed of the server and network latency
		became responsible for whether the server could update a client with its
		new set of visible ranged entities fast enough so that they were spawned
		before the player could view that part of the map.
		* Makes GameMap code cleaner, clearer, and concise with less redundancy.
	* Renamed MapEntity.getCreationMessage to getShowNewSpawnMessage and
	getShowEntityMessage to getShowExistingSpawnMessage.
	* Dead monsters are now removed from a player's controlled mobs list
	* When the entity id counter of a entity pool in a map overflows,
	EntityPool.nextEntId() skips over entities that are still alive.

2011-06-14  GoldenKevin  (revision 40)

	* Fixed monsters being uncontrolled by a client immediately after the
	controlling client is echoed back the monster's first move.
	* Revised various other calls to sendToAll that used the ranged entity
	no-echo overload pre-r39, so that a message isn't echoed back to the client
	that sent the message when it is unnecessary and a waste of a bandwidth.
	* Player's controlled mobs list is now thread safe (possibility of
	concurrent access since the mob respawn thread and various packet handler
	threads can access a player at the same time).
	* GameMap.updateMonsterController() now will actually go through the entire
	player entity pool to find the most suitable candidate for a mob controller
	instead of just assigning the job to the first non-hidden player in the pool
	* An inventory full message is now shown when a player tries to pick up more
	mesos than technical limits would allow.
	* Fixed some things regarding monster aggro.

2011-06-25  GoldenKevin  (revision 41)

	* Renamed Timer to Scheduler to avoid any ambiguity/confusion with
	java.util.Timer (plus, makes auto import much less annoying).
	* When a player changes channels, their buffs are sent to the receiving
	channel so that buff expires are synced up and buff effects are recognized.
	* Summons now are removed from the map when the owner player leaves, and
	spawn when the owner player enters into a new map.
	* Fixed integer overflow causing LittleEndianReader.readLong to return
	incorrect values.
	* Summons/puppets now removed from map when changing maps/channels, or when
	logging off. Summons are respawned on the new map if changing maps/channels.

2011-06-27  GoldenKevin  (revision 42)

	* Fixed skill levels and reactor states being skipped when loading from MCDB
	* Database access rehaul. Added in a connection pool model as a replacement
	for the thread-local connection model when using the OIO network model
	(thread per connection), so that the max amount of database connections is
	not exceeded. All calls to DatabaseConnection.getConnection now have to call
	DatabaseConnection.returnConnection, even when using thread-local.
	* Safer database PreparedStatement/ResultSet closing if an exception is
	thrown during database access.
	* Redesigned DatabaseConnection now throws out dead connections for both
	types of connection pooling, so that if a connection goes stale following a
	time out period, or network paths to the database are momentarily out, then
	it will try reconnecting by creating a new connection.
	* DatabaseConnection renamed to DatabaseManager. It is now completely thread
	safe.
	* Moved the catching of some SQLExceptions further upstream for performance
	and logging organization reasons (and to halt further initialization when a
	database error is encountered at server initialization).

2011-06-29  GoldenKevin  (revision 43)

	* Fixed activated energy charge not showing to other players when changing
	channels, and partial charge amount not transferring when changing channels.
	* Added in stubs for inner portal hacking check.

2011-07-01  GoldenKevin  (revision 44)

	* More meaningful exit codes. 2 = properties loading error, 3 = database
	error, 4 = center server connection error, 5 = server socket binding error.
	* For the moment, all external-facing servers will die when they lose
	connection with the center server since currently there is no (automatic)
	reconnect interface, and thus the servers pretty much become useless.
	* Packaged libraries have been updated. Rhino has been updated from version
	1.7R2 to 1.7R3, MySQL Connector/J from 5.1.14 to 5.1.16, and Netty from
	3.2.3 to 3.2.4. MySQL's .jar and Rhino's .jar files have been recompressed
	to reduce their size by a few kilobytes, so they do not match the size of
	the download you would get on their respective websites.
	* Fixed a potential performance/thread-safety problem in the packet encoder.
	The ClientSession is now retrieved only once instead of twice to reduce Map
	lookup costs and to prevent a condition where another thread removes the
	channel's ClientSession in between the two calls to ChannelLocal.get.
	* Mini room "map boxes" are now referred to as balloons. Hint box renamed to
	hint balloon in PortalActions.
	* Added in support on the login server for updating rankings. Updated SQL.

2011-07-02  GoldenKevin  (revision 45)

	* Major refactoring done to split Player into three specific classes that
	are each tailored to their server type in an effort to be more memory
	efficient. No more unused fields in the Player class of any server.
	* Logical reordering of packages:
		* Everything from the argonms package is now in argonms.common. All
		classes and packages from the argonms.character package have been moved
		to argonms.game.character, and the Player class has been turned into an
		interface that is now in argonms.common.
		* Moved package argonms.loading to argonms.common.loading, and moved all
		of its subpackages and classes with it.
		* Moved package argonms.net to argonms.common.net, and moved all of its
		subpackages and classes with it.
		* Moved package argonms.tools to argonms.common.tools, and moved all of
		its subpackages and classes with it.
		* argonms.map and its subpackages and classes have been moved to
		argonms.game.field (field is used to reduce confusion with the
		java.util.Map collection). GameMap's class name remains unchanged.
		* argonms.game.clientcommand renamed to argonms.game.command.
		* argonms.center.recv.RemoteServerListener moved to argonms.center.
	* Some refactoring done (including some ugly use of generics and the factory
	pattern) to eliminate a substantial amount of casts between Clients and
	Players of different server types in common classes, thus making the code
	appear 100% type safe.
	* May have fixed the mistaken auto-dc issue. We now start listening for the
	ping response before sending the ping, in case the client responds faster
	than we could set up the heartbeat listener.
	* Improved wording of some low-level networking logged messages.
	* Fixed match cards minigame not resetting completely.

2011-07-03  GoldenKevin  (revision 46)

	* Further refactoring done to remove references to argonms.game and its
	subpackages from code in argonms.common, argonms.login, and argonms.shop.
	argonms.game.character.inventory renamed argonms.common.character.inventory,
	argonms.common.Player moved to argonms.common.character.Player, and
	argonms.game.character.KeyBinding to argonms.common.character.KeyBinding.
	* New abstract class inherited by LoginCharacter and ShopCharacter to reduce
	repeated code. CharacterTools includes routines common to all three Player
	implementations.
	* Reorganized chaotically ordered imports following the large-scale
	refactoring of the previous revision.
	* Shop server now uses ShopWorld instead of LoginWorld for host/port state.

2011-07-03  GoldenKevin  (revision 47)

	* Even more common operations added to CharacterTools.
	* Fixed NullPointerException when creating a character.
	* Game server online messages now display the channel id and the world.
	* argonms.common.inventory.ItemTools -> argonms.game.character.ItemTools
	* argonms.game.character.skill.PlayerStatusEffectValues renamed to
	argonms.game.character.PlayerStatusEffectValues.
	* All packages in argonms.common.loading moved to argonms.game.loading
	except item and string loading.
	* Split MonsterStatusEffect enum from MonsterStatusEffectValues class and
	moved it to argonms.common (dependency for StatusEffectsData, which is in
	turn a dependency of ItemDataLoader).
	* Split PlayerStatusEffect enum from PlayerStatusEffectValues class and
	moved it to argonms.common.character (dependency of StatusEffectsData, which
	is in turn a dependency of ItemDataLoader).
	* argonms.game.character.skill.Cooldown
	and argonms.game.character.skill.SkillEntry to argonms.common.character
	as they are both needed by the shop server. The rest of the classes in their
	old package have been moved to argonms.game.character.
	* argonms.game.character.QuestEntry moved to argonms.common.character as it
	is needed by the shop server.

2011-07-05  GoldenKevin  (revision 48)

	* Moved methods isFourthJob and isBeginnerSkill from
	argonms.game.character.SkillTools to argonms.game.character.Skills.
	* argonms.game.character.Skills renamed to argonms.common.character.Skills
	as it is a dependency of CommonPackets (needed for shop server).
	* CommonPackets split into GameCommonPackets, which provides routines that
	are dependent on game server classes/packages.
	* Each subpackage of the root argonms package can now be placed in its own
	.jar file as the center, game, login, and shop subpackages are now all
	independent of each other. argonms.center, argonms.game, argonms.login, and
	argonms.shop all depend only on the argonms.common package.
	* Removed world and channel arguments in the ClientSession constructor as
	they are not needed.

2011-07-06  GoldenKevin  (revision 49)

	* Included some more SQL files that may need to be executed depending on the
	type of data loading that the external-facing servers use. None of them are
	necessary at the moment (except default_shops.sql), but will be needed in
	the future. argonms.sql moved to the new sql folder in trunk.
	* argonms.common.character.inventory.InventoryTools.getPersonalSlotMax moved
	to argonms.game.character.ItemTools since it depends on GameCharacter and
	SkillDataLoader. ItemTools.getPersonalSlotMax now behaves as expected.
	* Support for NPC shops. If using KVJ, sql/default_shops.sql must be run.
	MCDB should be fine without any additional database modifying.
	* Implemented a proper unique ID generator. Cash shop implementation is
	still far off, but cash items that you give yourself will now have a proper
	UID. Please update your database with the updated argonms.sql.
	* Roger's Apple quest script now checks whether your inventory is full
	before Roger's Apple is given.
	* InventoryTools functions deal more gracefully with rechargeable items.
	* InventoryTools functions now will accept a 4-byte int for quantity, since
	even though the highest slot max (3000) is way below Short.MAX_VALUE, these
	functions don't necessarily work on only one slot. Maximum amount of slots
	per inventory is 255, while the maximum quantity per slot is 3000, so the
	actual maximum quantity that the functions should accept is 3000*255=765000.
	* Stubs for NPC item storage.
	* Fixed clients closing while connecting.

2011-07-13  GoldenKevin  (revision 50)

	* ItemDataLoader's loaded items list is now a set, since it is more
	"contains"-heavy than add-heavy, and although HashSet is not as fast as
	ArrayList in adding, HashSet's contains method runs in constant time rather
	than linear time like ArrayList's.
	* Merged packages argonms.center.recv and argonms.center.send to
	argonms.center.net.internal, since their distinction is blurred by the fact
	that the CenterRemoteInterface classes of argonms.center.send references
	their respective RemoteCenterPacketProcessor classes.
	Moved CenterRemoteSession and RemoteServerListener with them.
	* Reorganized the overloads of CommonPackets.writeItemInfo. The main
	overload now uses a switch case instead of a series of conditionals.
	* Added IInventory interface, to be implemented by the old Inventory class,
	the new StorageInventory class, and a future CashShopInventory class.
	* Moved the empty argonms.game.field.NpcMiniroom interface into GameClient
	to be an inner interface.
	* Trade and shop transactions will now trigger a notification for a
	completed quest if the quest after gaining a needed item.
	* Moved storageslots column from characters table to accounts table, since
	it's account-wide data. Please update your database.
	* Added a Npc.wz data loader, which currently only loads the storage costs
	of NPCs. KvjBin needs to be updated to r25 in order to compile Npc.wz. Mcdb
	currently uses hard coded values until I make a better solution.
	* Implemented the main parts of NPC storages. Everything except
	"Arrange Items" is fully working.

2011-07-13  GoldenKevin  (revision 51)

	* Further reorganized packages for consistency. Packages have been created
	even if they only contain one class or if their fully qualified names are
	annoyingly long for the sake of logical grouping and hierarchy.
		* All 2nd level packages now share the same package structures
		* argonms.common.field created for argonms.common.MonsterStatusEffect
		(consistency with argonms.game.field)
		* argonms.game.character.StorageInventory and
		argonms.game.character.ItemTools moved to
		argonms.game.character.inventory (consistency with
		argonms.common.character.inventory)
		* argonms.game/login/shop.net packages created, along with the internal
		and external subpackages of net for consistency with argonms.common and
		argonms.center. Appropriate classes have been moved into them.
		* argonms.game/login/shop.handler moved to
		argonms.game/login/shop.net.external

2011-07-13  GoldenKevin  (revision 52)

	* Performed an Eclipse code cleanup. Pretty much removed all unnecessary
	casts, organized imports, rerouted inherited static field access to base
	class, and added missing @Override annotations to all overriden methods and
	implemented methods (only allowed in Java 6, but it's okay since there's
	quite a lot of Java 5 incompatible code in the source anyway).

2011-07-18  GoldenKevin  (revision 53)

	* Added in MCDB version checks.
	* Login character uses a single copy of the default key bindings that are to
	be saved to the database with new characters, since all new characters
	should share the same initial key map. Should speed up character creation.
	* InventoryTools.addToInventory updated to use an algorithm that the client
	would more likely expect. Instead of filling all existing slots of a certain
	item first and then filling in empty slots from the start of the inventory,
	it now iterates over the slots in order and fills them, no matter if they're
	previously partially filled by the same item or empty.
	* Simplified StorageInventory.remove. The inferred contract of startedItems
	(based on its name) is that it should not be altered except when opening the
	storage keeper.
	* Fixed some strange compile errors around ClientListener instantiations
	that NetBeans did not catch earlier.
	* Removed unused methods from BitTools, and renamed it to BitTool.
	* TimeUtil renamed to TimeTool.
	* argonms.common.tools renamed to argonms.common.util.

2011-07-18  GoldenKevin  (revision 53)

	* Fixed NullPointerException in InventoryTools.

2011-07-18  GoldenKevin  (revision 54)

	* Renamed MapleAESOFB to MapleAesOfb. Initialisms of three or more letters
	should be camel case instead of upper case.

2011-07-18  GoldenKevin  (revision 55)

	* Anonymous instances of ClientFactory use the correct argument names.
	* References to MapleAESOFB now reference MapleAesOfb.
	* NpcMiniroomHandler no longer prints out debug messages when withdrawing
	from the storage.
	* DatabaseManager.ThreadLocalConnections now removes exceptions that have
	already been thrown from getConnection().
	* AES-OFB cipher is tested on external facing servers at initialization, so
	initialization can be stopped if it is discovered that the JCE Unlimited
	Strength files are not installed. Exception handling in MapleAesOfb is now
	simpler. AES key should be thread safe, so it is now a static variable that
	is only instantiated once (instead of one per instance of MapleAesOfb as
	before). Access to non thread-safe Cipher in MapleAesOfb now is in a
	synchronized block, as calls to MapleAesOfb.crypt are not necessary
	thread-safe.

2011-08-13  GoldenKevin  (revision 56)

	* Renamed BitTool to ByteTool since it only performs operations on 8-bit
	integers.
	* Greatly simplified and cleaned up MapleAesOfb.getNewIv. The random
	variable names were really bugging me, so I took the time to decode what the
	method was doing and reworked it to my standards. Took some hints from Vana
	to simplify getPacketHeader and checkPacket.
	* Formatted the key constants in MapleAesOfb to align with each other, even
	if there was an unnecessary byte cast. Removed the last 10 bytes from
	"funnyBytes" (now renamed ivKeys) as it was impossible to access them, since
	the index range was 0 to 255 (the expression used by the only accessors of
	the array is (byte & 0xFF)).
	* Temporary fix for a race condition in MapleAesOfb where the IV was not
	updated before the next send/receive operation started. This caused the
	client to seemingly drop all packets when at least two packets were sent in
	parallel, such as the drop expire tasks when there are a large amount of
	drops made in the exact same time (i.e. when a monster dies) and they all
	expire at the same time on different threads. Removed the hack in the
	GameMap.drop overload that accepted a list of drops.
	* In order to fix the race condition in MapleAesOfb in the most efficient
	way possible, I had to move the IVs to ClientSession and pass them to
	MapleAesOfb methods instead of storing them as instance variables. I found a
	way to use GlobalConstants.MAPLE_VERSION directly instead of keeping a copy
	of it as MapleAesOfb state. MapleAesOfb is now effectively stateless, so I
	turned it into a static class.
	* MapleAesOfb now uses ThreadLocal Ciphers for a thread-safe method of
	encrypting data using AES, as it is impossible to continue using
	synchronized Cipher per MapleAesOfb instance since MapleAesOfb is now a
	static class. Should cut instances of MapleAesOfb by half when using OIO,
	and cut it to the amount of worker threads when using NIO.
	* Added !clearmobs and !cleardrops commands. !stat command now sets the EXP
	to a valid EXP for a particular level when setting or adding levels.

2011-08-14  GoldenKevin  (revision 57)

	* Password hashes and salts are now stored in raw binary in the accounts
	table. This should reduce the space used for password data in half. Also
	salt is now a fixed size BINARY instead of VARBINARY, since its size is
	always 16 bytes, so it will save an extra length byte for each account with
	a non-null salt. Only disadvantages are more difficult reading (hexadecimal
	is better suited for reading binary, and raw binary can result in
	non-printable ASCII chars), and inability to use SHA1 hash generators online
	to paste for an account using MySQL Query Browser (which is mitigated by the
	allowance of plaintext in the password field for new accounts. it can still
	be done by executing the query "UDPATE `accounts` SET `password` = X'hash'",
	replacing hash with the hexadecimal hash. This works for INSERT INTO too).
	* Rewrote LoginClient's authentication method. Fixed NullPointerExceptions
	when a user with a non-SHA512 password and a null salt enters an incorrect
	password.
	* TelnetSession updated to support new authentication. Also added a "help"
	command.
	* HashFunctions rewritten to reduce instantiation costs (MessageDigest
	instances are now thread-local) and to support the new password hash format.
	* Implemented CheatTracker. Replaced all "TODO: hacking"s.
	* RankingWorker updated to support new banning format.

2011-08-23  GoldenKevin  (revision 58)

	* Rewrote all networking classes to be independent of Netty. I realized the
	Netty pipeline wasn't flexible enough for me to ensure that messages were
	being sent in order to the message queue and being sent in order from out of
	the message queue, so I decided to forgo using the library altogether and
	write my own server socket code (even writing my own hashed wheel timer for
	idle checks). Currently only uses NIO for *Listeners and OIO for connectors,
	but I'll probably support both in both situations later on. May write a NIO2
	asynchronous IO wrapper as well once Java 7 becomes more widely deployed.
	* Reorganized all networking classes to be consistent across all protocols
	used (MapleStory client protocol, ArgonMS interprocess protocol - acceptor,
	ArgonMS interprocess protocol - connector, and Telnet protocol), so each
	protocol type has analog classes with each other. *Session instances contain
	the low level networking socket state (the new Session interface is meant to
	relate this), while *Interface/*Client instances the higher level
	non-networking state (all implement the SessionDataModel interface). For
	acceptors, *Listener instances keep track and create/destroy *Session
	instances as connections come and go. For connectors, *Session classes have
	a static connect() method.
	* Moved Telnet listener package from argonms.common to argonms.center. Split
	TelnetSession class into TelnetClient to separate socket networking and
	higher-level protocols (it's not perfect right now and will have to be
	improved, but it's getting there). Improved the virtual terminal
	capabilities as well.
	* Parallel read and writes are now more elegantly handled for ClientSession
	as an in-house solution is much more flexible (in fact, now we don't even
	need receive IV locks because it's all done on the Selector loop thread). So
	far, the performance is looking to be as good as Netty (probably from the
	directness of the code, being all hard-coded, and the lack of unused and
	boilerplate code for unneeded features, considering the fact that I'll never
	match the prowess of these networking experts, especially Trustin Lee. Just
	watch out for race conditions because I may have missed something.
	* Amount of external libraries has been reduced to two!

2011-08-23  GoldenKevin  (revision 59)

	* Fixed idle tasks being triggered after a session has closed.
	* A bit of code cleanup.
	* Fixed login and game servers disconnecting from center server because of a
	false ping timeout.
	* Fixed Center Server always giving a stack trace when a telnet user types
	EXIT instead of closing their client by other means.
	* Removed the -c option from !cleardrops and !clearmobs because I think that
	all encryption concurrency issues are fixed, and it was primarily a
	debugging tool.
	* Added SessionCreator interface to relate *Listeners and the *Session
	classes that have a static connect method.
	* To remedy the large amount of lines being logged everytime a user
	disconnects, Session.close now accepts a disconnect reason so that the
	caller doesn't have to log extra lines with redundant information. This
	means that some socket read/write/accept/close IOExceptions may be logged at
	the FINE level, which should be okay because most of them can be ignored.
	These exceptions are very common as they are received everytime a remote
	process is killed before its socket can send an EOF and shutdown gracefully.
	* Only Session.close logs messages with the word "disconnected" now. The
	wording of the messages of interserver connections and disconnections use
	the word "link", and do not log the socket address as it is redundant with
	the "connected" log message in the SessionCreator classes.
	* Fixed a possible race condition in TelnetSession.processRead.

2011-08-26  GoldenKevin  (revision 60)

	* The nuances of updating and accessing MySQL's user defined variables in
	the same statement broke RankingWorker because of the join on the accounts
	table, so I reworked the ordering of the statement a bit (hopefully, future
	versions of MySQL won't break it again if they start optimizing and
	evaluating in a different sequence). I moved it to a stored procedure in the
	SQL file so that it is defined only once. This is beneficial as the
	statement doesn't have to be transferred from the Login server to the MySQL
	server ever. Also, it can be executed from anywhere, so if it is desired to
	refresh the rankings immediately, you do not have to tinker with the Login
	server.
	* RankingWorker will no longer check for IP bans, only account bans. Once
	bans are implemented, GMs, at their discretion, will be able to easily ban
	any accounts that share recent IPs or MACs in order to get all characters of
	the user off the rankings and as an unbypassable measure to forbid the user
	from logging onto any of its other registered accounts (spoofing your MAC or
	IP won't help if your account is banned!)
	* Added two stored procedures to the SQL file. `updateranks` will update a
	particular rank list, specified by its parameters, while `fetchranks` will
	return a result set of a particular rank list, specified by its parameters.
	Be sure to execute the new SQL or else your Login server's RankingWorker
	will spew out errors.
	* Account name is now set on the Game server.
	* Fixed exception when player logs off with a summon active.
	* Fixed quest starting automatically even if user clicked Decline when
	completing a quest that automatically starts the script of a "next quest".
	This fixed the starting act of an autostarted quest being performed twice.
	* Expiration time is now applied to items rewarded from a quest. Although
	as of the moment, items don't expire (probably will get working on that when
	writing the cash shop).
	* Fixed GameCharacter.gainExp overflow. All calls to gainExp and gainMesos
	are overflow-conscious when sending the gain value.
	* Fixed ScheduledHashWheelExecutor misbehaving when scheduling without a
	period (caused it to infinitely reschedule a task). Calling shutdown on it
	will no longer immediately shut it down, but will only cause the service to
	stop accepting tasks, as the documentation for ExecutorService states. The
	service will never die if a task throws an exception. HashedWheelFuture's
	cancel method now responds to the mayInterruptIfRunning parameter. Fixed a
	couple of race conditions as well, although most likely not all of them.

2011-09-10  GoldenKevin  (revision 61)

	* All swallowed InterruptedExceptions should now be handled properly.
	* TelnetSession and ClientSession sendMessages methods tweaked a bit to use
	one less variable.
	* Fixed logic errors and simplified code using OrderedQueue.
	* OrderedQueue.getNextPush() now uses an AtomicInteger so all methods of
	OrderedQueue are now thread-safe Simplifies TelnetSession somewhat.
	(ClientSession still needs it under a mutex so that it corresponds with the
	IV update order, though).
	* UnorderedQueue class created to be symmetric with OrderedQueue in other
	Session classes. pop() has been improved from the old sendableMessages() by
	having it iterate only once through the queue rather than twice (i.e. once
	in ArrayList's constructor and another in ConcurrentLinkedQueue.removeAll).
	* Removed redundant passing of world ID in interchannel communications.
	* InterChannelCommunication is now thread-safe - remote channels can be
	safely registered while other tasks are being processed.
	* Changed the log text again for associating internal network servers as I
	feel it is more symmetrical ([un]registered) and less confusing.
	* Fixed PlayerLog not properly removing players from the name lookup table.
	* Fixed login server giving incorrect job rank in character select screen.

2011-09-19  GoldenKevin  (revision 62)

	* Fixed ShopServer class.
	* Implemented buddy lists.
	* Fixed packet reading issue when using INTER_CHANNEL_ALL.
	* Buddy chat now works, as will party and guild chat in the future when they
	are implemented. Also linked spouse chat handler with the packet processor.
	* Implemented /whisper and /find client commands.
	* Changed contract of entries in bans table in database. Entries are removed
	at login if all of the account's infractions are pardoned or expired. This
	way, the user won't be banned after every infraction that occurs once they
	are unbanned. The side effect of this is that pardoning is essentially
	irreversible once the user logs in for the first time after they are
	unbanned, unless the bans table is altered. They can still be rebanned,
	however, if their infractions points goes over the limit again.
	* Because *Server.initializeData is so heavily IO bound and can run for an
	indeterminate amount of time, it is executed in a new thread so it does not
	delay the worker thread pool of RemoteCenterSession. For a single thread
	worker thread pool, this can make RemoteCenterSession unresponsive to other
	messages, result in disconnection if initializeData does not complete in 30
	seconds (idle + ping timeout time).
	* Fixed Map loading from Kvj files if not using preloadAll.

2011-09-30  GoldenKevin  (revision 63)

	* Hidden players no longer are echoed their text if they send a map chat.
	It can be misleading if you see it in your chat box yet nobody else does.
	* Client command syntax standards altered a bit. Heavily influenced by the
	MySQL syntax pages on the web. All-caps signifies a literal string while
	lowercase signifies a variable argument. Curly brackets around arguments
	indicate a required argument while square brackets indicate optional ones.
	Pipes are used to signify that more than one type of argument can be passed.
	* Added !who and !uptime commands.
	* Fixed wrongful auto bans when Improved HP Recovery is leveled up.

2011-09-30  GoldenKevin  (revision 64)

	* Fixed a huge issue in ClientSession.send. The array is now copied before
	being encrypted. This caused a problem when the array needed to be used
	again after being sent (e.g. in GameMap.sendToAll with multiple players on
	map).
	* Fixed a busy wait in SessionCreator loops (Selector for *Listeners, the
	read loop for RemoteCenterSession) if we did not receive the amount of bytes
	we need in one read.
	* OrderedQueue.pop() tweaked a bit to properly handle integer overflow of
	the cursors.
	* MapleAesOfb.getPacketHeader(), MapleAesOfb.getPacketLength(), and
	argonms.common.util.input.* should use bitwise operations, not arithmetic
	when working with byte splicing, just to make intentions clearer. Cleanup in
	some other methods in MapleAesOfb and ByteTool.
	* MapleAesOfb.getPacketHeader() renamed to makePacketHeader.

2011-10-07  GoldenKevin  (revision 65)

	* Cash weapons now showing properly in character avatars (character select
	page, 3rd person views from map, smegas, messenger, etc.)
	* Slightly rewrote visible/masked equips logic in CommonPackets.writeAvatar
	to use less conditionals.
	* Fixed map crash when a player set a mastery level for a ranged weapon and
	they knock-backed a mob.
	* Fixed self crash when a player has a cash equip. Rings no longer crash,
	but ring effects still aren't implemented yet.
	* Added !maxequips, !maxskills, and !maxall commands.
	* !spawn command updated to support specifying an amount of mobs to spawn.
	* LittleEndianWriter.writePaddedAsciiString and writeNullTerminatedString
	will no longer throw NullPointerException.

2011-10-08  GoldenKevin  (revision 66)

	* Fixed logged off buddy not appearing as offline in a player's buddy list
	if the buddy changed channels at least once since he/she logged on.
	* Increasing inventory capacity in !maxall command is now made optional
	since that particular operation is still a work in progress and can result
	in client crashes if the user overruns his/her inventory.
	* Improved several scattered database queries/updates by moving
	prepareStatement calls to outside of a loop if there is one and fixing some
	resource leaking possibilities. Fixed TelnetClient not loading ban
	expirations correctly.
	* Implemented the Personal Info feature (i.e. double click on a character,
	or right-click a character->Personal Info in game server) and incrementing/
	decrementing a player's fame. SQL needs to be updated.

2011-10-10  GoldenKevin  (revision 67)

	* Fixed some logic errors on faming.
	* Fixed shop loading when using default tables without preloading.

2011-10-17  GoldenKevin  (revision 68)

	* Session.close now returns boolean whether the Session was successfully
	closed or not (usually indicates that it hadn't already been closed before).
	This isn't so much a new feature since most times we don't care if the
	Session was closed or not, but makes subclassing easier for a feature that I
	want to implement in the future.
	* Eliminated the world, channel instance variables from ClientListener, and
	the world, channel parameters in ClientFactory. I realized that the only
	time those values were needed was for constructing GameClient, but we could
	send those values from the instance variables of WorldChannel to the
	anonymous class when constructing GameClient, so it became redundant.
	* ClientListener instantiation moved to init() in LoginServer and ShopServer
	and the constructor of WorldChannel. WorldChannel instantiations moved out
	of file IO try-catch block.
	* Some cleanup in TelnetListener.
	* Failed channel changes are removed from the queue in WorldChannel.

2011-10-29  GoldenKevin  (revision 69)

	* Simplified and rewrote life movement packet parsing to be more accurate.
	* Fixed loading character before it is committed when changing channels.
	This will make changing channels feel slightly slower, but it ensures that
	the receiving channel loads the correct state. Fixed some functions getting
	called twice from changing channels.

2011-11-18  GoldenKevin  (revision 70)

	* Further streamlined encryption by simplifying MapleAesOfb.nextIv. No more
	intermediate step of converting the 4-byte array into a 32-bit integer.
	* Fixed NullPointerException when a mob is attacked while Blind, Hamstring,
	or Charge is cast.
	* Fixed mob debuffs (by player attack, passive, and buff skills) expiring
	immediately. Fixed skills that freeze the mob. Currently Hamstring and I/L
	Element Composition work correctly. Implementations for poison, Doom, and
	the rest of mob debuffs coming soon.
	* Fixed KvjSkillDataLoader.loadMobSkill.
	* PlayerSkillEffectsData and MobSkillEffectsData renamed shouldPerform to
	makeChanceResult (which is what the predecessor from OdinMS was named). Its
	previous name did not describe its purpose well enough.
	* GamePackets.writeMonsterData is more accurate.
	* Skills are now aware of mob's elemental immunity.
	* Mob's random skills are now applied (GameMovementHandler). Have to test
	this one though since I have a feeling that my analysis and interpretation
	is utterly wrong.

2011-11-19  GoldenKevin  (revision 71)

	* Renamed PlayerStatusEffect.STANCE to PlayerStatusEffect.POWER_STANCE.
	* Fixed anti-cheat false positive when using Energy Charge and it stops you
	from being knocked-back by a mob (basically the effect of power stance).
	* Added some more anti-cheat consistency checks for Power Guard, Energy
	Charge, and Mana Reflection.
	* Fixed NullPointerException when a mob dies and one of its attackers had
	already disconnected. I assumed that GameCharacters would be garbage
	collected immediately after log off, and hence would not linger in weak
	references once disconnected (in this case, the damages WeakHashMap). Fixed
	other potential problem with a similar scenario in
	GameCharacter.getMobDeathHooks().
	* Fixed potential race conditions/NullPointerExceptions in
	GameMap.killMonster, GameMap.removeMonster, Mob.wasAttackedBy, and
	Mob.giveExp. Mob.hurt, Mob.addDeathHook, Mob.died, and
	Mob.executeDeathHooksNoRewards should now be immune to very rare
	ConcurrentModificationExceptions.
	* Added some @Override annotations in GameCharacter to methods that Eclipse
	strangely missed in r52.
	* Apparently using Iterator.remove on ConcurrentLinkedQueue.iterator()
	results in memory leaks. Fixed UnorderedQueue.pop() to exclusively use the
	safe poll() method and ScheduledHashedWheelExecutor's worker to instead use
	a Set backed by a ConcurrentHashMap.

2012-01-02  GoldenKevin  (revision 72)

	* Fixed ConcurrentModificationException in !cleardrops and !clearmobs
	commands.
	* Reverted a change (r65) that caused undefined behavior when equips
	inventory has more than 100 slots.
	* Calling Future.cancel(true), usually through a ScheduledFuture instance,
	results in the occasional java.nio.channels.ClosedByInterruptExceptions. All
	calls to cancel now do not attempt to interrupt an executing task to avoid
	this crashing of communications (which may result in seemingly random
	disconnections of remote servers).
	* All threads started by the server now have descriptive names. Added a new
	ThreadFactory for the scheduled thread pool in Scheduler, used Thread ctor
	that allows specifying name in the data preloading threads in GameServer,
	LoginServer, and ShopServer, and ScheduledHashedWheelExecutor's worker.
	* Command usage syntax revised a bit from MySQL documentation style to POSIX
	shell style. Any non-literal options ("names of parameters that require
	substitution by actual values") are in angled brackets. Literals are no
	longer in all caps, and everything is in lower case. Required options lose
	the curly brackets. Optional arguments still retain the square brackets.
	Parentheses should not be treated as literals and are used to disambiguate
	mutual exclusion situations.
	* All commands must have a usage string in addition to its help string.
	Typing --help anywhere in an existing command will print out its usage and
	help messages rather than execute the command.

2012-01-29  GoldenKevin  (revision 73)

	* Fixed the most common mob and reactor drops not dropping when drop rates
	were too high (integer overflow).

2012-01-29  GoldenKevin  (revision 74)

	* Updated copyright years.

2012-03-18  GoldenKevin  (revision 75)

	* Made precedent for further party synchronization among center server and
	game servers of the same world
	* Renamed the game server's Party class to PartyList because of its
	parallels with buddy lists
	* Implemented basic party list creating, disbanding, inviting (and denying),
	expelling, joining, leaving, and a temporary change leader. More to come
	* Fixed CommandProcessor copyright year
	* CommonPackets.VIP_MAPS trimmed to ten NULL_MAPs. I've been tracing code
	and realized that at most, we only send ten VIP maps, so why do we have an
	array of fifteen?
	* Put names to some magic numbers in
	InterChannelCommunication.sendPrivateChat

2012-03-19  GoldenKevin  (revision 76)

	* Defensive programming against concurrency errors. This revision introduces
	fixes for GameCharacter, Inventory, and Mob, which all have methods that
	could be accessed by more than one worker thread. Right now, they use simple
	mutex monitors because concurrency is not really an issue for individual
	players, inventories, and mobs as they don't scale upwards
	* Renamed MobDeathHook to MobDeathListener and NPC script's endChat to
	chatEnded to be more consistent with the observer (AKA publish/subscribe)
	pattern
	* Began work on PartyMemberListener class for when we need hooks for our
	party events. Currently no events are fired because I haven't bothered with
	looking through the source yet...

2012-03-24  GoldenKevin  (revision 77)

	* Use ConcurrentMaps in GameCharacter. This actually is less safe against
	race conditions (e.g. we don't lock while an existing SkillEntry is getting
	set to a new value and when we send packets with the size of the map
	followed by an iteration over the map, we can error 38 the client) and has
	worse performance because we have to instantiate more objects than we need
	and calling size when writing packets is linear time, but for the
	GameCharacter class, it's more about preventing complete failure from
	ConcurrentModificationExceptions than anything else. All assignable
	variables in GameCharacter are volatile (as opposed to Atomic wrappers),
	even though we use non-atomic operations like compound assignments which
	can cause race conditions. We don't mind if returned values are a few ticks
	old because we don't have high concurrency requests from a single client, a
	few timers, and the map, so there will probably be no visible problems
	anyway. questSubscriptions has not been touched because several operations
	that modify it cannot be done atomically. I found that it is better for
	minigameStats to continue using an EnumMap rather than a ConcurrentHashMap
	just for performance reasons. All of these are accessible only in the
	GameCharacter class anyway, and the main point of this update was just to
	get rid of synchronization outside of the GameCharacter class.
	* GameCharacter.setMinigamePoints turned into incrementMinigamePoints. This
	is actually a bit safer with regards to race conditions, plus it simplifies
	Minigame.endGame. AtomicInteger is now used for the actual stat values
	because they both allow us to get rid of all synchronization in the
	individual stat map for every game, as we can use a mutable integer wrapper
	and not have to deal with mutator methods in the game stat map.
	* Fixed up weird mob EXP. Also fixed some race conditions while I was at it.

2012-04-05  GoldenKevin  (revision 78)

	* Database changes
		* We don't actually reference the symbols for our InnoDB foreign keys
		(constraints), so don't worry about them in our .sql file and just let
		MySQL name them with its default conventions. Let MySQL use the default
		generated names for keys too because they are sufficient for us (we can
		assume the names of the keys because there will be no conflicts with
		other same-named keys in a new table).
		* Added a few more keys (indices) in strategic places to speed up some
		lookups and removed a few unnecessary ones that would waste disk space
		and processing time during row insertion and deletion.
		* macbans table uses a surrogate primary key rather than a composite
		natural key to be more consistent with other tables.
		* Added a parties table.

2012-04-14  GoldenKevin  (revision 79)

	* Fixed potential CancelledKeyExceptions in *Session classes.
	* Rewrote the channel change/log off triggers for GameCharacter. Fixed some
	methods being called twice when changing channels.
	* Added party bonus to monster EXP. Any member who is five levels below the
	monster's level or five levels below the lowest leveled attacker will be
	given a share of the EXP if he did at least one damage to the mob.
	* Fixed bug when a party member leaves the party and was the only member in
	his channel.
	* Proper packet for party leader change. Made some fixes to the other party
	packets as well.
	* A party is unloaded when all its members become offline or when it is
	disbanded. A party is loaded when the first member becomes online or when it
	is created.
	* Implemented cross-channel parties. Player's party data is now saved when
	logging off, and is loaded when logging in.
	* Party members are notified when a member changes maps, changes levels,
	changes jobs, or changes HP.
	* Renamed some InterChannelCommunications methods to be more consistent.

2012-04-16  GoldenKevin  (revision 80)

	* Phase one of GameCharacter hierarchy realignment. MapEntity is now an
	interface that GameCharacter implements so that GameCharacter is free to
	inherit Player (or one of its subclasses).

2012-04-16  GoldenKevin  (revision 81)

	* Eliminated argonms.common.character.Player interface, replaced by
	argonms.common.character.Player.LimitedActionCharacter and
	argonms.common.character.Player.CharacterTools refactored into instance
	methods. LoggedInPlayer is now in its own file and is now an abstract class
	that inherits Player.
	* GameCharacter and ShopCharacter inherit LoggedInPlayer instead of just
	implementing it. LoginCharacter inherits the new Player class. Renamed
	instance variables in Player to be consistent with duplicate variables from
	GameCharacter and they now have protected access. Removed these duplicate
	variables from GameCharacter, as well as duplicate accessor and mutator
	methods.

2012-04-22  GoldenKevin  (revision 82)

	* Every party member in the same channel shares a single PartyList instance.
	This should reduce RAM usage and bandwidth between the center server and the
	game servers, but increases complexity somewhat and may raise a few gotchas
	revolving around sharing an instance between more than one player.
	* Rearranged some packets and renamed several party related things to be
	more consistent and to make their meanings clearer.

2012-04-27  GoldenKevin  (revision 83)

	* Removed reference to argonms.game in GameCenterPacketProcessor.
	* Fixed disbandment of party when a member is offline.
	* Fixed mastery sometimes causing error 5 to other players in map (and
	giving wrong color based on skill level).
	* Fixed mob item drops can be leeched by anyone. Still need a solution for
	reactor drops.

2012-05-12  GoldenKevin  (revision 84)

	* New method for distributing mob EXP. This finally refactors that huge,
	ugly Mob.giveExp method into more manageable chunks. If a party attacks a
	mob and that mob has another attacker outside the party, the distribution
	makes a bit more sense (before, the party would get the mob's full EXP
	instead of only a share based on how much damage it did). It is somewhat
	more object oriented now, although not as much as I would have liked.
	* Autoban detects when client wants to control a mob that it did not aggro.

2012-05-20  GoldenKevin  (revision 85)

	* Fixed game server not removing party when last online member logs off
	* Fixed expelled party member or leaver remaining in party list if he was
	the last online member and another member logged on before he was saved to
	the database
	* Disabled banning system for now until I find a better solution to detect
	excessive amounts of suspicious activity that could be from packet editing

2012-06-09  GoldenKevin  (revision 86)

	* Fixed party EXP bug where you got 5% bonus EXP for being in a party of one

2012-06-20  GoldenKevin  (revision 87)

	* SocketChannel should already be closed before CloseListener.closed is
	called, so there is no need to cancel the associated SelectionKey.
	* Synchronize closing of a socket channel (which in turn closes its
	associated selection key) with any operations that require the key be valid,
	to avoid several race conditions.

2012-06-20  GoldenKevin  (revision 88)

	* Rearranged ClientSession.send(byte[]) so that length of a message won't
	have any effect on the queue insert number of the message and instead is
	mostly dependent on when the method was called.
	* Let players linger in their channel and map after client disconnection
	until all the remaining messages read from the client are processed. Should
	fix problems with null characters when a client disconnects while it still
	has queued messages.

2012-06-20  GoldenKevin  (revision 89)

	* Use Connection.isValid(timeout) instead of Connection.prepareStatement
	("/* ping */ SELECT 1") for DatabaseManager.connectionCheck since MySQL
	Connector/J implements both pretty much the same (except it returns false
	instead of throwing an exception if the connection is closed and doesn't
	instantiate a "fakeSelectOneResultSet") in a more readable and concise
	manner. (cf. com.mysql.jdbc.ConnectionImpl.pingInternal(boolean
	checkForClosedConnection, int timeoutMillis), com.mysql.jdbc.JDBC4Connection
	.isValid(int timeout), com.mysql.jdbc.ConnectionImpl.ping(), and com.mysql
	.jdbc.StatementImpl.doPingInstead()). The Java 6 only argument is moot since
	we use other Java 6 APIs.
	* argonms.common.util.DatabaseManager.CachedConnectionPool.getConnection()
	throws out dead connections and tries the next one until there are none left
	rather than immediately replacing them with fresh connections. Only if there
	are no (valid) connections does it create new ones. This should clear out
	all dead connections in a single call to DatabaseManager.getConnection()
	since the least recently used connections are the ones that time out first
	and are also the first to be connection checked. The only downside is that
	the pool has to throw out all the connections in the cache before we realize
	that the database server is offline.

2012-06-20  GoldenKevin  (revision 90)

	* Fixed deadlock in RemoteCenterSession. Reverted changes to that file from
	r87.
	* DatabaseManager.ThreadLocalConnections.getConnection() now always throws
	an SQLException if the database server cannot be reached rather than return
	null in some cases. Refactored out connectionCheck since it's body is a
	single line.

2012-06-20  GoldenKevin  (revision 91)

	* Added all server side NPC scripts for NPCs on Maple Island. The eclectic
	text is meant to be faithful to GMS v0.62 yet free of blatant misspellings
	and broken English.
	* Most commonly called methods outside of NpcConversationActions now have
	aliases in that class or its super class. The idea is to minimize the scope
	of scripts so that refactoring the sources will have less pitfalls.

2012-06-22  GoldenKevin  (revision 92)

	* All Lith Harbor NPCs (except Chef, since I can't find any reliable script
	for him, and Duey and EXP Gachapon because they're too complicated at the
	moment) are now scripted.
	* argon.sql updated.

2012-06-23  GoldenKevin  (revision 93)

	* Fixed improper usage of Rhino Context instances.
	* Packaged libraries have been updated. Rhino has been updated from version
	1.7R3 to 1.7R4 and MySQL Connector/J from 5.1.16 to 5.1.20. MySQL's .jar and
	Rhino's .jar files have been recompressed to reduce their size by a few
	kilobytes, so they do not match the size of the download you would get on
	their respective websites.

2012-06-28  GoldenKevin  (revision 94)

	* Enabled JavaScript version 1.7 features in Rhino.
	* var declarations are replaced with let in all scripts since its behavior
	is more akin to local variable declarations in Java.
	* Don't let scripts capture continuations if client disconnected.

2012-06-30  GoldenKevin  (revision 95)

	* Scripts for Henesys area NPCs with NPC IDs in the 101200x range.

2012-07-04  GoldenKevin  (revision 96)

	* Scripts for Henesys area NPCs with NPC IDs < 9102100 and NPC ID 9200100
	(bowman job advancement, Henesys PQ, Henesys beauty shops, etc.).
	* Added in stub files for unimplemented Lith Harbor scripted NPCs so I don't
	forget about them in the future.

2012-07-08  GoldenKevin  (revision 97)

	* Renamed script API isQuestFinished to isQuestCompleted.
	* Fixed NullPointerException in QuestChecks.hasPet.
	* Finished all NPC scripts for Henesys area.

2012-07-10  GoldenKevin  (revision 98)

	* Fixed Athena Pierce script.
	* Added Ellinia NPC scripts in the 103200x range.

2012-07-11  GoldenKevin  (revision 99)

	* Fixed problems in InventoryTools with regards to equipped inventory
	handling.
	* Finished Ellinia area scripts (or at least created stubs for them).

2012-07-11  GoldenKevin  (revision 100)

	* Fixed messed up reactor drop source position.
	* Reactor and NPC scripts now are named after the script name fields in
	their respective data files instead of their numeric ID. MCBB users must
	execute default_reactor_scripts.sql and default_npc_scripts.sql.

2012-07-11  GoldenKevin  (revision 101)

	* Fixed player NPC script.

2012-07-14  GoldenKevin  (revision 102)

	* Inventory.increaseCapacity, StorageInventory.increaseCapacity, and
	BuddyList.increaseCapacity nows clip capacities to <= 0xFF. Capacities no
	longer overflow when increased beyond max.
	* Proper packets for increasing inventory capacity. Thanks Vana!
	* Removed null.js. Apparently Duey is not scripted, but instead is
	hardcoded in like shops and storages.
	* Changed sourceName for scripts again. They should be the relative path to
	the executed script file, with the scripts folder as the root directory.

2012-07-14  GoldenKevin  (revision 103)

	* Implemented all Perion area NPCs.

2012-07-14  GoldenKevin  (revision 104)

	* Unignore Eclipse project files outside of trunk since Eclipse project
	should reside in trunk only.

2012-07-16  GoldenKevin  (revision 105)

	* Implemented all Kerning City NPCs in the 10520xx range.
	* Made unscripted NPC notice more legible.

2012-07-18  GoldenKevin  (revision 106)

	* Implemented Kerning City beauty NPCs and Monster Carnival NPC.

2012-07-20  GoldenKevin  (revision 107)

	* Reverted r87's synchronized valid checks and socket closing. No need to
	make read and writes contested just to prevent such a rare case that has no
	side effects.
	* SessionCreator.shutdown rewritten to resemble Session.close.
	* Added shutdown command, though not yet fully implemented.
	* Fixed channel port change.

2012-07-21  GoldenKevin  (revision 108)

	* Fixed NullPointerException when shutting down server.
	* Fixed percentage based potions.
	* Implemented Kerning City Party Quest NPCs.

2012-07-22  GoldenKevin  (revision 109)

	* Implemented or added stubs for remaining Kerning City area NPCs.
	* LoginServer loads for shutdown game servers are reset to 0.

2012-08-02  GoldenKevin  (revision 110)

	* Began a refactor of scripting APIs.
	* Fixed syntax error in Bell's script.

2012-08-02  GoldenKevin  (revision 111)

	* Started work on events.
	* Finished script refactor started last revision.
	* Fixed some more of improper usage of Rhino with regards to passing Java
	objects into a script's scope.

2012-08-09  GoldenKevin  (revision 112)

	* Fixed persistent events loading before Scheduler was enabled.
	* Added more features to script bindings and to EventManipulator. init()
	function in event scripts now accept an attachment.
	* Added EventManipulator field in GameCharacter.
	* One of Cloto's lines is more GMS-like now.

2012-08-09  GoldenKevin  (revision 113)

	* Updated supported Kvj format to r29.
	* Kerning City event script is fully implemented. Now I just have to
	implement blocked portals so players can't skip stages.
	* Fixed potential memory leak in ScriptPlayer.
	* EventManipulator methods relating to player and party are now used. Still
	have not added hooks for mobs.

2012-08-09  GoldenKevin  (revision 114)

	* Cleaned up Cloto's script. kpq.js renamed to party1.js.
	* Fixed NullPointerException when Kerning PQ times out, error when any party
	member but the leader leaves while in the PQ, and TypeError when a party
	tries entering when another party is still inside.
	* Temporary implementation for portal blocking in Kerning PQ.

2012-08-10  GoldenKevin  (revision 115)

	* Added NPCs for John's jump quests and Chrishrama in Sleepywood.

2012-08-10  GoldenKevin  (revision 116)

	* Added rest of Sleepywood area NPCs.

2012-08-10  GoldenKevin  (revision 117)

	* Updated supported Kvj format to r30.
	* Implemented chairs
	* Implemented EXP loss.

2012-08-16  GoldenKevin  (revision 118)

	* Disabled Kerning PQ debugging by default. Debug messages are now a bit
	more informative.
	* Fixed exception when giving prize in Kerning PQ.
	* Reverse engineered portal blocked packet for Kerning PQ.
	* Implemented Free Market portals.

2012-08-19  GoldenKevin  (revision 119)

	* Inventory item loading performance substantially improved for a large
	database (but will take longer to save and will take more space on disk).
	Ban checking on login and highest party ID loading on game server
	initialization marginally improved with larger tables.
	* A bit more consistency in column definitions in argon.sql. Maximum width
	of integral datatype is that of the maximum value of the datatype, with
	space for a negative sign if the datatype is not unsigned, unless we know
	that the value of that column never exceeds some other width (i.e. 1 for
	boolean values in tinyint).
	* UniqueIdGenerator now does postincrement instead of preincrement, so value
	of `uniqueid`.`nextuid` actually is the next UID. We no longer skips UID 1.
	* Quest reward items without expirations will not expire immediately.

2012-08-20  GoldenKevin  (revision 120)

	* EventManipulator.partyDisbanded and partyMemberRemoved combined into
	partyMemberDischarged(partyId, playerId). Scripts that care about party
	events (in the event-driven programming sense) should have enough state to
	distinguish the two cases.
	* events/party1.js script rewritten to maximize code reuse and fix some
	bugs. npcs/party1_play.js script only gives EXP only to party members that
	are still participating in the PQ and only gives one pass per member in the
	first stage.
	* Implemented return scrolls.
	* Added a bit of consistency when using InventoryTools.UpdatedSlots and
	GameCharacter.itemCountChanged(itemId).

2012-08-22  GoldenKevin  (revision 121)

	* Updated supported Kvj format to r31.
	* Implemented equip scrolling.
	* InventoryTools.randomizeStats uses more accurate stat ranges.
	* Hands and level field of equips are treated as equals with other equip
	stats. More consistency among equip field access and mutating.

2012-08-22  GoldenKevin  (revision 122)

	* Rewrote EventManipulator. Rather than pass a bunch of IDs to the script,
	it now instantiates script binding wrappers for the actual entities.
	* Kerning PQ now retains timer for all stages.
	* Use Context.javaToJS instead of Context.toObject. Equivalent Java types
	are now converted to JavaScript primitives instead of being passed as either
	JavaScript wrapper objects or native JavaScipt objects of Java wrapper
	objects. Fixes a lot of issues with event variables, booleans, and null.
	* EventManipulator allows access to event variables from Java code without
	having to deal with JavaScript wrapping.
	* Enable Rhino optimization of all scripts besides NPC scripts.

2012-08-22  GoldenKevin  (revision 123)

	* Updated supported Kvj format to r32.
	* Greater flexibility with time zones. Expiration dates, clocks, and
	miscellaneous in-game output are no longer bound to the server's default
	time zone. Note that this doesn't affect the output of log messages nor does
	it affect the time zone of JavaScipt Date objects.
	* Added script for ship between Ellinia and Orbis. Although it works, I will
	not enable it by default in game*.properties until I finish implementing all
	Victoria Island NPCs and then move on to Ossyria.
	* ScheduledHashWheelExecutor.HashedWheelFuture.get() throws
	ExecutionException for all submitted tasks that are ended early because of
	an exception.

2012-08-22  GoldenKevin  (revision 124)

	* Fixed NullPointerException in portal and reactor scripts if player is not
	a member of a party.
	* Scrolling equips for HP and MP no longer clips remaining HP and MP to the
	max HP/MP values that have the equip's bonus HP/MP subtracted from them.
	* Unequipping an item that has an HP bonus will now update the client's
	remaining HP bar if remaining HP is clipped.
	* GameCharacter.equipChanged called for equipped items that are replaced by
	another equip item of the some category.
	* Fixed packet for cursed scrolled equips.
	* Scroll no longer consumed if equip has no upgrade slots.
	* Fixed player's remaining HP/MP being clipped to base max HP/MP on login.
	Don't clip remaining HP/MP until after equip max HP/MP bonuses are applied.

2012-08-23  GoldenKevin  (revision 125)

	* Removed unused PartyMemberListener class.
	* Fixed any unsorted import blocks.
	* Updated switch-cases to use a consistent formatting style.
	* Added private constructors and final modifier to utility classes.
	* Added final modifier to instance variables where appropriate.
	* Removed Game prefix from names of game server handler utility classes.

2012-08-23  GoldenKevin  (revision 126)

	* Some cleanup of changes made in the last revision.
	* Added interface for login server features that have been implemented but
	unused. The login.properties file customizes these features.

2012-08-23  GoldenKevin  (revision 127)

	* Removed balloon message debug statement in LoginServer.
	* MapleAesOfb class renamed to ClientEncryption.
	* Removed current directory from classpath in *.bat and *.sh scripts.
	* Packaged Bouncy Castle 1.47 provider for JDK 1.5 - JDK 1.7.
	* Bouncy Castle lightweight API is now used instead of JCE for AES
	encryption. Removed illegal key size checks in server inits as we are no
	longer dependent on JCE unlimited strength jurisdiction files.
	* Use Bouncy Castle instead of JCA for SHA digest in HashFunctions class.

2012-08-24  GoldenKevin  (revision 128)

	* Renamed ClientEncryption.aesCrypt to aesOfbCrypt.
	* Split a loop of aesOfbCrypt into several loops in order to reduce number
	of conditional checks and make the routine marginally faster. Also removed
	unnecessary try-catch block and Logger.

2012-08-27  GoldenKevin  (revision 129)

	* Miscellaneous edits to ClientEncryption. checkPacket is now works properly
	for MAPLE_VERSIONs greater than 127.
	* Better understanding of magic numbers in ClientSession.sendInitPacket().
	* Removed dependency on java.awt.Rectangle in npcs/party1_play.js.
	* events/ship_ossyria.js spawns Balrog mobs when invasion ships are spawned.

2012-08-31  GoldenKevin  (revision 130)

	* Buffs are canceled when a player dies and respawns. Hide no longer
	glitches in such a scenario.
	* Eliminated any array copying and division in loops in HexTools methods.
	* Replaced getLt() and getRb() methods from PlayerSkillEffectsData and
	MobSkillEffectsData with a getBoundingBox method.
	* Moved Poison Mist specific routines from GameMap.spawnMist.
	* Started implementing Poison Mist, but it still does not work correctly.

2012-09-04  GoldenKevin  (revision 131)

	* Rearranged argon.sql to highlight dependence relationships among tables.
	Previously was inconsistent - most table declarations were in alphabetical
	order but some were rearranged due to foreign key constraint failures on
	script execution.
	* Tables in argon.sql are deleted in the reverse order that they were
	created to avoid foreign key constraint failures.
	* Removed all implicit/default modifiers in argon.sql to make the script
	more concise (i.e. DEFAULT NULL and DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1). Although InnoDB
	is now default in MySQL 5.5, I want to make sure that the tables support
	transactions even if the script is executed on a server with an older MySQL,
	so the engine is still explicit.
	* Same treatment for argon.sql is given to other files in /trunk/sql/*.sql.
	default_monster_drops.sql and default_shops.sql files are replaced rather
	than modified because their diffs would be bigger than the files themselves.
	* `infractions`.`assignertype` is now NOT NULL.
	* `inventoryitems`.`uniqueid` no longer unsigned because server does not
	store 64-bit unsigned unique IDs. `inventoryitems`.`expiredate` and
	`expiredate` and `receivedate` in `infractions` no longer unsigned because
	timestamps are stored as 64-bit signed value on the server.
	* Arbitrary line breaks in queries that strictly adhere to 80 characters per
	line replaced with ones with looser width limits and group related parts in
	a line. 80 character width is obsolete and broken up strings make less sense
	after a lot of refactoring.

2012-09-05  GoldenKevin  (revision 132)

	* Fixed formatting of .sql scripts that I missed last revision.
	* Fixed client never fully dissociating if an exception occurred while
	processing a packet.
	* PreparedStatement.executeUpdate() in loops has been replaced with
	addBatch() and executeBatch() wherever possible.

2012-09-05  GoldenKevin  (revision 133)

	* GameCharacter.updateDbQuests executes mob progress batch once rather than
	for every quest. Refactored generated keys fetching to remove a try-catch.
	* GameCharacter.updateDbQuests only inserts mob progress for quests that are
	still in progress. Server never needs to deal with mob kill count for
	completed and forfeited quests. Speeds up the insertion of completed and
	forfeited quests since those can now be batched. GameCharacter.loadPlayer
	avoids an unnecessary mob progress query for completed quests.
	* Don't delete expired things from database in GameCharacter.loadPlayer.
	Defer deletions to when the character is saved. Expired bans are removed for
	a client after loading them during login only because the login server does
	not have a central routine for saving client data before control is
	transferred to the game server.
	* Fixed infraction spam when changing channels while hide is disabled and
	is then enabled upon channel enter.

2012-09-10  GoldenKevin  (revision 134)

	* Removed a conditional in GameMap.spawnEntity and spawnExistingEntity.
	* Map players now see when a player updates his skin color, hair, face.
	* Simplified GameCenterPacketProcessor.processPartyFetchList.
	* Full support of Maple Messenger chat rooms.

2012-09-16  GoldenKevin  (revision 135)

	* MapFactory is now thread safe.
	* Added pirate job advancement NPC.
	* Added scripts to get players out of 2nd job advancement challenge maps.
	* Each player doing a 2nd job advancement challenge now gets his own
	instance of the map. events/change_job.js handles this for us.

2012-09-16  GoldenKevin  (revision 136)

	* Refactoring to reduce nesting in InterChannelCommunication and
	GameCenterPacketProcessor. Only methods in that class get large enough that
	early out (return in methods, continue in loops) can significantly reduce
	the maximum level of indentation compared to single-entry single-exit.
	* Calls to CenterServer.getAllServersOfWorld in GameCenterPacketProcessor
	moved to outer loop whenever applicable because repeatedly calling that in
	an inner loop is more expensive than getting the other Collection.

2012-09-17  GoldenKevin  (revision 137)

	* Support for the newest Kvj format.
	* Stubs for remaining Henesys area NPCs.
	* Stubs for several event NPCs.
	* Added Florina Beach NPC.
	* Added NimaKIN and KIN NPCs.
	* Fixed any possibility of client crash when choosing new eyes or hair.

2012-09-17  GoldenKevin  (revision 138)

	* Added remaining Nautilus Harbor NPCs to complete Victoria Island NPC
	scripts.

2012-09-18  GoldenKevin  (revision 139)

	* Updated some NPC scripts after consulting DelphiMS scripts.
	* Updated several scripts so they are based on the more accurate Vana
	scripts rather than those from KiniroMS.
	* Updated some scripts that multiple NPCs share.
	* Added a missing Maple Island script. Peter (NPC 2002) is also in the WZ
	files, but v0.62 doesn't have Mushroom Town so I didn't include him.
	* Vana consulted scripts have their documentation changed to read r3171
	instead of r2111 if applicable (cny no longer exist in r3171, so it is left
	as r2111).

2012-09-18  GoldenKevin  (revision 140)

	* Fixed begin_jp1.js.
	* Script formatting changes I missed last revision.

2012-09-19  GoldenKevin  (revision 141)

	* Revisited ScheduledHashedWheelExecutor. Rewrote all thread-unsafe code,
	corrected the broken invokeAll and invokeAny methods, and cleaned up.

2012-09-20  GoldenKevin  (revision 142)

	* ScheduledHashedWheelExecutor now will never misplace a task into the wrong
	bucket. It required moving three division operations, a (fairly predictable)
	branch, and a few instances of addition/subtraction and casting into a mutex
	block shared with the worker thread, but avoiding reschedules should offset
	any performance losses.

2012-09-22  GoldenKevin  (revision 143)

	* Support for scrolling messages in game server.
	* Added !heal command.
	* Fixed some misuse of Player.getMaxHp(), GameCharacter.getCurrentMaxHp(),
	Player.getMaxMp(), and GameCharacter.getCurrentMaxHp().

2012-09-23  GoldenKevin  (revision 144)

	* Rearranged DealDamageHandler.handleRangedAttack and handleMagicAttack to
	minimize latency between a player's attack and its reflection on the screens
	of other players in the map.
	* Stubs for Happyville NPCs.
	* More consistent TODO descriptions in NPC scripts.
	* npcs/begin7.js is now based on the corresponding Vana script.

2012-09-25  GoldenKevin  (revision 145)

	* Optimized NPC scripts with long sequences of sayNexts.
	* Fixed NPC script bug when sayNext, say, and sayNext were called right
	after another in that very order.
	* Added askBoxText public function to ScriptNpc.
	* No need for Mob.controller to be a WeakReference since we null the
	reference whenever the controlling player leaves the map.

2012-09-26  GoldenKevin  (revision 146)

	* Fixed item based reactors.
	* Started work on Henesys PQ. Added all NPC scripts and added event script.
	No event code handles Moon Bunny getting hurt yet and no rice cakes are
	dropped.
	* Updated Henesys PQ scripts to be more GMS-like.
	* Kerning PQ map config initialization is done before party is warped in.

2012-09-30  GoldenKevin  (revision 147)

	* Support for the newest Kvj format.
	* Fixed events/ship_ossyria.js not clearing Balrogs before the start of its
	next run.
	* Growlie now warps party out in the same conversation that it clears the
	stage. The leader does not have to click him again after clearing.
	* Fixed Henesys PQ event script not destroying itself when exiting from Pig
	Town.
	* Fixed Moon Bunny spawning in the wrong direction in Henesys PQ.
	* Henesys PQ scripts are functionally complete - implemented rice cake drops
	and Moon Bunny getting hurt.
	* Ariant Coliseum bomb mob actually explodes. All mobs that self destruct on
	a timer rather than at a certain HP are now supported.

2012-09-30  GoldenKevin  (revision 148)

	* Fixed quest mob progress going over the requirement if the player attacked
	more than one of the required mobs and then killed some of them after
	completing the requirement.
	* Fixed random item rewards for quests.
	* Fixed job check for quest item rewards.

2012-10-21  GoldenKevin  (revision 149)

	* All beginner skills (except Monster Rider and Follow the Lead) are
	functional, although Recovery does not display the HP recovered in big blue
	numbers above the player's head.
	* Got rid of custom time zone in TimeTool only. The value specified in the
	properties files now apply for the entire Java process, so the logger dates
	and times, the Rhino/JavaScript Date objects, MySQL Connector/J setDate
	functions, and everything that used TimeTool before use a consistent
	time zone. Note that any messages logged before the properties files are
	successfully read will use the server's time zone.
	* CenterServer allows custom time zone for message logging and MySQL
	Connector/J purposes.

2012-10-23  GoldenKevin  (revision 150)

	* Arrow drops now drop a quantity in the range of 10-25 instead of just 1.
	* Players in map are shown the raw damage a player has taken (i.e. before
	Magic Guard subtracts HP damage).
	* Skills Disorder and Threaten now inflict both their mob effects on mobs.

2012-10-25  GoldenKevin  (revision 151)

	* Corrected behavior of stacking items. Obtained items will always fill up
	any unfilled slots of the same item before they start taking up empty slots.
	* Fixed buying equips or enough items to fill up an entire slot (100 potions
	for example).
	* Fixed mob counting quests not incrementing properly if mobs are not killed
	in one hit.
	* Fixed quest completed notices repeatedly popping up for a quest even if
	its requirements were already fulfilled before they were checked again.
	* Maple TV NPCs no longer show the placeholder script for shop NPCs.
	* Fixed NullPointerException for mob skills.
	* Allow movement between The Forest East of Henesys and On the Way to the
	Harbor.

2012-10-26  GoldenKevin  (revision 152)

	* Added full support for Camila's Gem jump quest.

2012-10-27  GoldenKevin  (revision 153)

2012-10-27  GoldenKevin  (revision 154)

	* Added NPCs and NPC stubs for NPCs in New Leaf City.
	* Added persistent event for subway between New Leaf City and Kerning City,
	and enabled it by default in game*.properties
	* Fixed Kerning City ticket gate not taking basic tickets to New Leaf City.
	* Fixed Kerning City ticket seller giving the wrong items.
	* Ellinia Station ticket usher does not allow a player to visit Orbis unless
	the ship_ossyria persistent event is enabled. The player is no longer
	instantly warped there.

2012-10-27  GoldenKevin  (revision 155)

	* StatAllocationHandler now mutexes SP and AP allocation so concurrent
	modifications by "megatubi" enabled clients don't cause issues.
	* Fixed ticket gates for Kerning City and New Leaf City subways.
	* Fixed Magic Guard not burning additional HP if MP is depleted.
	* Added a stub to handling the Dispel skill (including a new method that is
	application for other party skills).

2012-10-29  GoldenKevin  (revision 156)

	* Refactored `shopitems` table in default_shops.sql so the `shops` table is
	no longer needed.
	* Added shops for Nautilus.
	* Removed some inaccurate shop items.
	* Added bullets in applicable shops.
	* Fixed portal to Utah's Pig Farm.
	* Fixed NPC script for trash can in Nautilus.
	* Fixed Speed Potions.

2012-11-06  GoldenKevin  (revision 157)

	* Don't print the stack trace of a network IO error that closed a session,
	as it is meaningless and clutters the logs.

2012-11-06  GoldenKevin  (revision 158)

	* Fixed second job advancement scripts for warriors, magicians, bowmen, and
	thieves and made them more consistent.
	* Fixed any remaining race conditions for player quests by using a single
	mutex over all quest-related structures in GameCharacter rather than
	attempting to coordinate concurrent structures.
	* Player stats lock moved to LoggedInPlayer because login server players are
	immutable.

2012-11-07  GoldenKevin  (revision 159)

	* All commands rewritten to make use of a new argument parsing solution that
	does away with argument counts and argument indices in favor of a iterator
	interface.

2012-11-07  GoldenKevin  (revision 160)

	* Started work on experimental system that facilitates making commands apply
	for characters other than the calling character. The !tp, !info, !skill,
	!stat, and !give commands have been retrofitted to support this system.
	Currently the system only works on players that are either offline or on the
	same channel as the calling character.
	* Added !map command to change map of other characters or to warp to a
	specific spawn point in a map. When used with only one argument, it behaves
	identically to the /m command.

2012-11-09  GoldenKevin  (revision 161)

	* Fixed compilation error in WorldChannel.
	* CommandTarget.mutate accepts a List of properties to change rather than
	a Map.
	* !heal, !maxstats, !maxequips, and !maxall now support the command target
	system.
	* OfflineCharacterCommandTarget is now manually committed once after all
	updates have been made, in order to speed up commands such as !maxall.

2012-11-09  GoldenKevin  (revision 162)

	* Fixed invisible throwing stars or arrows when attacking with a claw or
	(cross) bow.
	* Fixed denying buddy invites.

2012-11-09  GoldenKevin  (revision 163)

	* Started work on experimental system that facilitates the creation of
	commands that could be called by a GM connecting over telnet.
	* !town now supports the command target system.

2012-11-10  GoldenKevin  (revision 164)

	* Support for the newest Kvj format.
	* Started work on supporting quest mob and reactor drops.
	* Reverted changes to WorldChannel and made LocalChannelCommandTarget do
	channel changes the right way.
	* Started work on experiment system that will eventually supplant
	InterChannelCommunication in a more object oriented and manageable manner.

2012-11-10  GoldenKevin  (revision 165)

	* Fixed TimeTool.intDateToCalendar.
	* Added !ban command and support for adding infractions to users that are
	offline.
	* Reenabled infraction system, although false positions for auto ban should
	be at a minimum now that I reduced points for machine detected packet
	editing to 0.1% of the tolerance - still high enough to catch cheaters after
	at most a few hours if they are abusing their hacks but low enough to allow
	an average of 33 false positives a day for infractions that last 30 days.

2012-11-10  GoldenKevin  (revision 166)

	* Fixed thread unsafe methods in CrossServerCommunication.
	* Replaced usages of Future in CrossProcessCrossChannelCommunication with
	BlockingQueues. This allows early outs in blocking calls in
	CrossServerCommunication when a desired value is found. Credits go to Markus
	Fuchs' WeakValueHashMap as inspiration for the WeakValueMap nested class.
	* Implemented replacement method for InterChannelCommunication's
	getChannelOfPlayer in CrossServerCommunication.

2012-11-10  GoldenKevin  (revision 167)

	* Implemented CrossServerCommunication methods for relaying all kinds of
	chats that go beyond a player's map.
	* Logic for returnPlayerExistsResult should not be repeated for both
	implementations of CrossChannelCommunication.
	* CrossServerCommunication.scanChannelOfPlayer early outs for same process
	channels that returned a result of true.

2012-11-10  GoldenKevin  (revision 168)

	* Early out checks in CrossServerCommunication methods similar to those in
	scanChannelOfPlayer and sendWhisper now loop rather than check once. While
	the existing code was sufficient for same process channels, this could also
	halt any unnecessary packet sending if a response packet was received after
	an earlier request.
	* Fixed and improved error messages for timed out blocking
	CrossServerCommunication calls.
	* Implemented CrossServerCommunication methods for relaying buddy list
	related operations.

2012-11-11  GoldenKevin  (revision 169)

	* Implemented CrossServerCommunication methods for sending party packets to
	the center server.

2012-11-11  GoldenKevin  (revision 170)

	* Refactored InterServerPartyOps so it can also replace top level opcodes
	between game and center servers for chatrooms with sub opcodes for "center
	server synchronization" once InterChannelCommunication is replaced.
	Refactored any instances of "party synchronization" to "center server
	synchronization."
	* Instances of "cross channel communication" refactored to "cross channel
	synchronization."

2012-11-11  GoldenKevin  (revision 171)

	* Fixed CrossServerSynchronization.fillPartyList.
	* Refactored remaining instances of "party synchronization" to "center
	server synchronization."
	* Added support for chatrooms in CrossServerSynchronization.

2012-11-11  GoldenKevin  (revision 172)

	* Dropped in CrossServerSynchronization to replace InterChannelCommunication
	and replaced any references of the old class name. Also refactored several
	methods so "interchannel" can no longer be found in any identifiers.
	* Fixed logic errors for player scan, whisper, buddy invites, and chatroom
	invites in CrossServerSynchronization.
	* Fixed CrossServerSynchronization.initializeLocalChannels.
	* Shortened the channel change response timeout to match cross channel
	synchronization blocking call timeout.

2012-11-11  GoldenKevin  (revision 173)

	* Implemented CrossChannelCommandTarget.

2012-11-12  GoldenKevin  (revision 174)

	* Rearranged !ban command arguments so ban reason can have spaces.
	* Rewrote !shutdown command to be more faithful to its inspiration.
	* Fixed bugs in chatroom invite and closing.
	* Split up receivedCenterServerSynchronziationPacket so each party operation
	gets its own method in CenterServerSynchronization.
	* Fixed error when deleting a buddy who has been invited but has not
	accepted the invite yet.
	* Prevent players from inviting as a buddy a player who has already invited
	himself/herself.
	* Players may re-add another player that they have deleted from their buddy
	list who still has himself/herself on their buddy list.

2012-11-14  GoldenKevin  (revision 175)

	* !tp command now gives all warnings to players before the warp is
	actually performed.
	* Disambiguated the subjects in !tp command warnings.
	* PartyList member order should now be consistent for each channel's copy of
	a party.
	* PartyList members can now be accessed by index.

	allocated to mastery skills for axes.
	* Implemented party buffs. Dispel, resurrection, time leap party skills as
	well as map buffs will be implemented soon.
	* Refactored several identifiers in StatusEffectTools.

2012-11-22  GoldenKevin  (revision 177)

	* Implemented Dispel player skill.
	* Implemented non-party AOE player buffs (Echo of Hero, GM Haste, GM Holy
	Symbol, GM Bless, GM Hyper Body).
	* Added stubs for remaining party/AOE player skills.
	* More constants are added to MobSkills class to reduce number of magic
	numbers in MobSkillEffectsData class.
	* Corrected some code for weapon attack up, weapon defense up, magic attack
	up, magic defense up, avoid up, and area of effect mob skills.
	* Corrected some code for Taunt and Time Leap player skills.
	* Fixed mob buffs expiring immediately.

	canceled before the new effects and cancel timer are applied.

	Blizzard (wizard), Ice Splitter, Paralyze, Poison Breath, Element
	Composition (fire/poison), and Hypnotize.
	* Added delay parameter for all status effect packets just for consistency
	(although it doesn't really seem to delay anything).

2012-12-02  GoldenKevin  (revision 179)

	* Fixed mob's elemental resistance not being changed by Doom.
	* Fixed duplicate ban entries in SQL.
	* Fixed gained 0 exp messages.

	* Fixed race condition when allocating SP.

2012-12-02  GoldenKevin  (revision 180)

	attacks something - reverted most of last revision's changes to
	DealDamageHandler.

2012-12-08  GoldenKevin  (revision 181)

	* Players using the "Hide" skill can no longer be located using the /find
	client command and any whispers to such players will return the error
	message that the player could not be found.
	* Kyrin now gives SP for the Pirate first job advancement.
	* Implemented skill macros.
	* Changed ban expiration calculation methods so the ban is lifted as soon
	as the total infraction points dips below the tolerance level.

	just the current game server.
	* Fixed NullPointerException when entering portals to maps not in the WZ
	files.
	* Fixed dropping equipped items not updating the avatar.

	* Fixed wrongful infractions and inability to start or complete quests with
	the GM jobs even though these actions are allowed by a clean client.
	* Implemented quests that change a skill level (i.e. fourth job skills
	quests that don't actually hand out skillbooks).

	RemoteCenterSession.close when an IOException is thrown while the init
	packet is being sent.
	* Fixed a portal script possibly executing multiple times in parallel for a
	player if there is high latency. Fixed the cause of the Free Market exit
	portal teleporting players back to the default map (Perion) if entry and
	exit is repeated long enough (by holding the up arrow at a town's Free
	Market portal, for example).
	* Added "!eventutil admit" command and split the usage and help messages for

	* Fixed inability to trade empty stacks of rechargeable items.
	* Fixed mob WATK+ buff being too effective by 100%.
	* Mobs spawn at random spawn points in the map that can accommodate more
	spawn rather than at the most exhausted spawn points. This discourages
	camping in one location.
	* Respawn rate lowered to once every 15 seconds. Rate is lowered but max
	spawn (abundancy) remains the same.

2013-01-21  GoldenKevin  (revision 194)

	* Added CommandCollection interface to facilitate adding commands from
	class files (outside of CommandProcessor) that contain multiple command
	definitions. CommandProcessor does not have to be aware of what specific
	commands are contained in the individual CommandCollection implementations,
	so CommandCollection implementations may now be extended without modifying
	CommandProcessor.
	* Fixed overflow in InventoryTools.getAmountOfItem. Now returns an int.
	* Added !take command for taking an item from a player.
	* Fixed bugs related to spawn points when exiting through the Free Market
	portal to the default map, Perion, when the saved location data is missing.
	* Allow warp to a map if the WZs for a portal have an invalid destination.
	* Less sensitive fast HP/MP regeneration detection.
	* Removed infraction triggers in AP and SP allocation because latency or
	tubi enabled clients may fire them.
	* Identified cause of Energy Charge effect showing in place of Dash.

2013-01-26  GoldenKevin  (revision 195)

	* Fixed QuestEntry.getData sometimes being out of order if the character

	commands now has his or her previous location saved.

2013-01-28  GoldenKevin  (revision 196)

	* CheatTracker now supports unmistakable hacking attempts, banning the user
	after just two attempts. Some existing calls to CheatTracker.suspicious have
	been retrofitted to use the correct option.
	* Added packet editing checks for negative item quantities in selling and
	buying items to NPC shops and in storing to storage keepers.
	* KvjSkillDataLoader no longer repeats file IO operations for skills that do
	not exist and SkillDataLoader immediately returns null when getting stats
	for skillid 0. Solves potential bottleneck in DealDamageHandler.parseDamage.
	* Removed unused instance variable in ScriptPartyMember.
	* Started working on game server side of guild lists by having it share bits
	of code with PartyList.
	* Implemented guild NPC scripts and added stubs for necessary bindings that
	cannot yet be implemented.
	* Do not allow scripts to call npc.responseReceived. Make that method
	protected and use a proxy class in the same package to indirectly call it.

2013-01-30  GoldenKevin  (revision 197)

	* Added infraction detection for attacking without a weapon.
