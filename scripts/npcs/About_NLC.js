As I went along in finding the means to do so, I encountered many people, some of whom I've come to regard as friends. Like Professor Foxwit-he's our resident genius; saved him from a group of man-eating plants. Jack Masque is an old hunting buddy from Amoria-almost too smooth of a talker for his own good. Lita and I are old friends from Kerning City-she's saved me a few times with that weapon of hers; so I figured she was a perfect choice for Town Sheriff. It took a bit of persuasion, but she came to believe her destiny lies here. About our resident explorer, Barricade came searching for something; he agreed to bring whatever he found to the museum. I'd heard stories about him and his brother when I was still in Kerning City. And Elpam...well, let's just say he's not from around here. At all. We've spoken before, and he seems to mean well, so I've allowed him to stay. I just realized that I've rambled quite a bit! What else would you like to know?");

In return for me saving him, he agreed to build a time museum. I get the feeling that he's come here for another reason, as he's mentioned more than a few times that New Leaf City has an interesting role to play in the future. Maybe you can find out a bit more... ");

			npc.sayNext("The MesoGears are beneath Bigger Ben. It's a monster-infested section of Bigger Ben that Barricade discovered. It seems to reside in a separate section of the tower-quite strange if you ask me. I hear he needs a bit of help exploring it, you should see him. Be careful though, the Wolf Spiders in there are no joke.");

Many new and powerful creatures roam those areas, so you'd better be prepared to fight if you head out there. It's at the left end of town. Rumors abound that the Jungle leads to a lost city, but we haven't found anything yet.");

He thinks he blew his chance, and began wearing that mask to hide his true identity. My lips are sealed about who he is, but he's from Amoria. He might tell you a bit more if you ask him.");

She trained for a very, very long time as a Thief. Matter of fact, that's how we first met? I was besieged a group of wayward Mushrooms, and she jumped in to help. When it was time to a pick a sheriff, it was a no-brainer. She's made a promise to help others in their training and protect the city, so if you're interested in a bit of civic duty, speak with her. ");
